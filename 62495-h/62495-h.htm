introducing my little romance to the
public, I do so with little misgivings or
apologies.
</p>

<p>
The close observer will agree that the
changes that are anticipated&mdash;here related
as established facts&mdash;are merely the signs of
the times, and that not one-half of the story
is told.
</p>

<p>
One might wish to be a living witness
of the great projects occurring A.&nbsp;D. 1999,
and may possibly resent that he was not
born later on in the cycles of Time, but if
his heart is in the right place he can realize
that there is nothing lost, and his soul goes
marching onward and upward in its eternal
flight.

<p>
<span class="firstWord">My</span>
caller was a queer little old woman. Her
figure, however, was erect, her eyes bright and
her voice low, soft and firm. She was becomingly
dressed, in what might appear to be a Quaker garb,
and a look of rare intelligence radiated her countenance.
</p>

<p>
In a deep, sweet voice, she began:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was born in the year of our Lord, 1828, and am,
consequently, in my 86th year. I have lived a long time,
but when I glance backward, it seems but yesterday that
I nestled in my mother&rsquo;s arms. I was born in Virginia in
the year Andrew Jackson was elected President and my
parents took me to Washington on the day of his inauguration.
We traveled in our own vehicle, drawn by
two dapple grey horses, and we had several neighbors as
companions each having a conveyance of their own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Schools were unknown in our neighborhood and my
early education was derived from my parents, principally,
assisted by a maiden aunt, who spent each summer at our
plantation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My clothes were cut out, fitted and made by my aunt,
and my hats lacked any feather trimmings or other finery.
The material of my dresses was generally of a slate color,
and but few other shades were affected. All of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">2</a></span>
neighbors dressed in the same way, without any affectation
of style whatsoever. But enough of this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The musical instruments of that day were the melodeon,
harp and violin. There were very few of even
these, and were confined, the melodeon to the village
church, the violin to our darkey&rsquo;s cabins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We read by a tallow dip during the winter nights, but
there was not very much to read, our library consisting of
the family Bible, Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrims Progress, together
with a weekly paper published in Philadelphia, that had
originally been started by Benjamin Franklin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was in the year 1850 that my people began talking
of going West, and tried to glean all the information they
could concerning the country they selected, the best means
of getting there and the prospects for disposing of our
plantation. It took us three years to finish all of our
preparations, and on April 18th, 1853, our caravan
started on the trail leading Westward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was 26 years old, and at a time of life when I could
thoroughly enjoy the ever varying changes of climate and
scenery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We found the Indians very friendly, even to kindness,
and we bestowed on them many cheap trinkets in return
for food and skins, of which they possessed a variety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We made many stops on the way as we reached the
then frontier settlements, now large and prosperous cities,
and it was not until we had crossed the Missouri river,
near Omaha, that we began anticipating trouble from the
Indians. We experienced the usual hardships and vicissitudes
from this cause, nothing unusual in those times,
and arrived in the then little city of Portland, March 19th,
1854.

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_003" id="Page_003">3</a></span>
&ldquo;I startled our little party, on our arrival in Portland,
by announcing that the next time I crossed the Continent
it would be on the steam cars.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Long and loudly was I laughed at for my optimism,
and it did really seem impossible for a locomotive to be
capable of climbing those seemingly inaccessible peaks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had I prophesied all that was in my mind, my friends
might have thought that I was deranged. I could have
said that I could see people flying through the air in
vehicles shaped like birds from the Atlantic to the Pacific
and that the almost impenetrable forests of Oregon would
one day be entirely laid low by the woodman&rsquo;s axe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There were many other things which I could see
were bound to come but I thought it wisest to keep the
light of my prophecies to myself rather than give them
to unheeding ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I saw in those days, however, will not compare
to the marvels which come to me now, at my advanced
age.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have given a receptive ear to the spirit which tells me
what others would pronounce &lsquo;queer notions,&rsquo; but which
I declare to be scientifically natural. I will tell you of all
these things and you may publish them to the world, and
allow them to be a judge of my optimistic views. I will
tell you what I see and also of what I know is sure to
come, so that all who read may know and understand,
and put themselves in readiness for the great events which
are bound to ensue by A.&nbsp;D. 1999.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady then, her eyes beaming with intelligence
and in the most natural and unassumed manner, voiced
the following prophecies:
</p>


<div class="chapter">

  </p>
  <h3><a href="#linkTOC02" title="Link to the table of contents.">Chapter II.</a></h3>
  <p class="chapter-title">The Prophecy.</p>
</div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">Taking</span>
a note book from her bag, and adjusting
her spectacles, the old lady began her remarkable
relation of events to come ere the
21st century shall have rolled around:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I may not be able to tell you
all that is in store for future generations, but I will
say enough to interest everybody and to warn everybody
who will care to heed my admonitions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The era of quick transit has already arrived and people
love to travel fast, and opportunity will be given all
who care to adopt this pastime. Very soon the locomotive
and trolley car will be altogether too slow for travel
and aerial voyages, both for pleasure and business will
ensue. The force used for this purpose will be varied
and may be electricity, gasoline, compressed air, or perhaps
still another potent agent, at present undeveloped,
which will usurp the place of all others, be cheaper, safer
and more reliable than any known energy. The cars will
be made entirely of steel bands and so constructed that
but little damage may be apprehended from a collision
with another flying machine. A parachute, arranged to
work automatically will be the chief protector of this
winged machine and this part of the apparatus will be so
constructed as to render an accident almost an impossibility.
Indeed, these carriers will be so made that a
party soaring in the air at a height of 500 feet will look
down and express a feeling of sympathy for those who
must brave the dangers besetting life on the surface of
this mundane sphere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">5</a></span>
&ldquo;These air carriers will be simple, and a good bright
boy can manufacture his own vehicle to take him to and
from school and at a less expense per day than is now
paid for street car fare, and at a lesser risk to life and
limb. The grocer will make his deliveries by his air machine.
The butcher boy will abandon his automobile and
bring his meat deliveries by the way the bird flies. As
there can be no tracks laid in the air, no one will be
pestering the City Commission for a franchise to run his
company&rsquo;s cars over a certain strata of air, but there
will be cars for hire, just the same, and there will be, no
doubt, long trains operated in the air not much unlike the
system at present in vogue on the surface. The death
dealing automobile will be a thing of the past and even
the merry motor cycle will have gone the way of the
equine. Railroads and railroad stocks will suffer and the
roads will languish and die. Aerial locomotion will usurp
the place of the steamer and the steamship, since it will
be proven to be quicker, safer and less expensive. Country
homes will be easy of access and, consequently, more
popular and the suburbs will be peopled by an ever increasing
number. There is no end to the advantages
which the flying machine possesses over the present
modes of locomotion and it is merely a question of solving
the problem of entire safety, economy and simplicity
of construction and operation, all of which will have
been surmounted in A.&nbsp;D. 1999.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Although the aerial navigation is itself an important
feature of future progress, it is not at all the most prominent
of innovations. I will tell you of the new era of
building.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006">6</a></span>
&ldquo;Portland in 1913 was considered a beautiful city, but
how much more beautiful does it look in 1999. I will
endeavor to give you a little idea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The wooden houses have become a thing of the past
and strong, warm concrete dwellings are the order of the
day. These abodes although immensely superior to the
dwellings of 1913 are less in cost and more adaptable for
homes. Every working man has his own flying machine
and his own home and should be happy and comfortable.
The city is compact and the business houses are lofty
and well constructed, safety to occupants being the chief
care.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Owing to the fact that there are few, if any, automobiles
or other rapid methods of travel to take up the streets of
our city, there was an order issued by the City Commissioners
removing the hard surface pavements and authorizing
the Commissioner of Public Service to sow the
streets in rye grass and Kentucky blue grass, so that the
city of Portland is one perpetual system of parks, where
the youngster may play to his heart&rsquo;s content. Just
imagine what a beautiful city we have and how our past
day metropolis would pale into insignificance beside the
picture I have drawn. Roses are planted in the streets
and we are really and truly the &lsquo;Rose City&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this juncture the old lady paused to consult some
notes which she read to herself, presently beginning
again, this time with a new topic:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Emigration flocked to Oregon after the opening of the
Panama canal and under the new conditions many of these
newcomers settled in and around Portland. The great
territory of Alaska has been pretty thoroughly prospected
and our city is the chief market for that great and wonderful
country. Our population equals or surpasses that of
Greater New York in 1913 and there is work for everyone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">7</a></span>
Portland embraces the entire county of Multnomah
and a portion of other adjacent counties and extends in
an unbroken line from Oregon City on the South to the
delta of the Columbia river on the North, East to the
foot of Mt. Hood and West to Hillsboro. There are no
more bridges across the Willamette river, tubes 75 feet
wide at every other street taking the place of the bridges.
These tubes are about a mile in length and start from
Broadway on the West side and extend to Grand avenue
on the East. Public docks extend from St. Johns to
Milwaukie and cover both sides of the river, which is
dredged the entire length of the dockage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Many of the hills back of the city, including Portland
Heights, Kings Heights and Willamette Heights are
leveled, only Council Crest with its historic traditions
being allowed to remain. This gives a vast area to West
Portland which is really vital to its business supremacy.
Columbia Slough was reclaimed and most of the manufacturing
industries are carried on at that point. St.
Johns was again taken into the fold and made happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again did the old lady consult her notes, making a
selection for a new topic, smilingly began:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The old Commission form of government inaugurated
in 1913 proved a success in every way. The first Mayor
under the Commission, H. Russell Albee, with his quartette
of capable assistants, Messrs. Wm.&nbsp;H. Daly, W.&nbsp;M.
Brewster, R.&nbsp;G. Dieck and C.&nbsp;A. Bigelow set the pace
for their under officials who tried to emulate their superiors&rsquo;
good work, the public reaping splendid results
therefrom. Each succeeding administration endeavored
to excel the former&rsquo;s record and Portland has been well
governed for the past 86 years. Auditor Barbur, too,
gave the city the fruits of his ripe experience in municipal
matters and was rewarded by being elected again and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">8</a></span>
again. When the city swallowed up the county of Multnomah,
additional commissioners were necessary to take
care of the increased business, and so popular did this
system of government become with the people that a
State Commission form of government was agitated and
finally adopted. The Governor and his Cabinet, composed
of 12 commissioners were moved to Portland which
became the state capitol. The State Commission had
the power to enact laws and possessed all the functions of
a state legislature, meeting each day to pass upon matters
which might come up for discussion or adjustment. The
Governor serving in 1913, Oswald West declined the
honor of running on a state commission basis and that
privilege fell to Robert Stevens who safely guided the
bark of Oregon through the breakers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The long list of state officials embraces many names
familiar to the public in the earlier part of this century,
notably, the names of Sewall, Malarkey, Coffey, Word,
Selling, Lane, Chamberlain, Gatens, Bourne, Nebergall,
Lightner, Lombard, Rushlight and many others whose
names were highly esteemed in Portland&rsquo;s early history.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The city, county and state buildings embrace five continuous
blocks beginning at Jefferson Street running
north, taking in Madison, Main, Salmon, Taylor and
Yamhill Streets, each building being ten stories high
and connected at each third story with its companion on
the opposite side of the street for a distance of five blocks,
making it practically one solid building five blocks long
and each building ten stories high.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are fifteen judges of the circuit court, seven of
whom are women. The sheriff and treasurer are women
and there are several women serving as bailiffs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The name of Abigail Scott Duniway is held in much
reverence by these women officials, who attribute to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">9</a></span>
the honor of being the promoter of woman suffrage in
Oregon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Many innovations have been made in the laws of
Oregon during the last 50 years, a number of them being
framed and mothered by women State Commissioners
and signed by Oregon&rsquo;s women governors. One of these
acts makes it lawful for a woman to retain her own name,
if she so desires after her marriage and not making it
compulsory for her to take her husband&rsquo;s name, so that if
Miss Montmorenci marries Bill Smith, she is not necessarily
compelled to assume her husband&rsquo;s name of Smith,
but can be known as &lsquo;Mrs. Helen Smith-Montmorenci.&rsquo;
This act has been the occasion of a number of our high-toned
girls with four syllable names marrying men of
plebeian extraction, so the law works well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The morals of the city have wonderfully improved.
There is less roystering, riotousness and lawlessness than
existed earlier in the century. There is no longer a Home
of Detention for boys and girls, Florence Crittenden
Home, a county or city jail, or a state penitentiary, all of
these institutions being done away with as they were
found unnecessary, expensive and not able to deal with
the situation in hand. Instead, a more Christlike form
of dealing with the socalled lawless element has been inaugurated
and the fruits became immediately apparent.
Alleged criminals were talked to like brothers and treated
like brothers, the hard spot in the hearts of each melting,
when, indeed, they did become like brothers. Men on the
rock pile were taken by the hand by good and true men
and women and made to feel that life had something in
it besides crime, and all became ready and anxious to
better their conditions and their morals and the Brotherhood
of Man became established on earth in its truest
significance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">10</a></span>
&ldquo;And so it was in handling the social evil. None were
so vile but would like to leave their sins; and a revolution
for the good was started which has ever since continued.
And this is the reason we have no homes for
criminals, for we have no more criminals. Isn&rsquo;t that
lovely?&rdquo; and the dear old lady smiled.
</p>

<p>
Continuing, she said, &ldquo;The art of &lsquo;moving picture&rsquo;
shows has given place to the science of &lsquo;motion picture&rsquo;
shows. We will say that a rendition of &lsquo;Shylock&rsquo; is given
in New York on Monday. The following Monday, the
very same performance can be produced in Portland, with
a counterpart of the actors&rsquo; figures, voices, stage setting,
even to the minutest particular, and it would be difficult
for one seeing both performances to tell which was the
original and which the copy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Owing to the little need for an elaborate education,
children are not compelled to go higher than the sixth
grade, the rest of their education being made up by practical
experience later in life. This, however, does not extend
to those seeking professional lives who are at liberty
to use their time as they choose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fourth of July, 1999, was celebrated in a way that the
men and women of former days would marvel at. The
air was filled with vehicles of all kinds and descriptions.
They all invaded the air from the little tad of four
years of age, who is riding in space at a height of five
feet just within reach of his parent&rsquo;s arms, to the more
daring air rider who soars the skies, at an elevation of
10,000 feet. There were no fireworks but there was
plenty of visiting above ground and music from 50,000
phonographs was listened to. One mighty band was
playing national airs, and although more than a century
and a half has elapsed since the anthem was written, the
&lsquo;Star Spangled Banner&rsquo; was received in the usual way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">11</a></span>
There are some new national hymns, but the olden ones
seem to be the most popular.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Rose Festival was celebrated two weeks prior to
this event. The celebration was unique and embraced a
pageant in the air, the electric parade being the feature
of the day. A genuine shower of roses let fall at a given
signal from tens of thousands of airships filled the air
with delightful perfume and the spectators with enthusiasm.
The performance was given three days in succession.
A reminiscent figure of the third day&rsquo;s parade
was a picture made in flowers and exhibited at a height
of 1,000 feet above the ground showing a picture of the
first president of the Rose Festival, who was none other
than our dear old friend, Ralph W. Hoyt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What might appear to the people of 1913 as very extraordinary,
is the manner in which the streets of the city
are sprinkled. A huge air bag with a rubber hose attachment
is allowed to rise to a height of about 1,000 feet and
water from the Willamette river is pumped up into it by
the good old fire boat, David Campbell, which is still
doing business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Attached to the air bag is a regular sprinkling machine
and as fast as the David Campbell pumps the water into
the bag it is allowed to fall on the city, the air bag, of
course, frequently shifting its position to give all parts of
the city an equal show for a rain storm. This process is
used whenever there is a drought in Multnomah county,
which, thank the Lord, is a seldom occurrence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Journalism has kept apace with the times and the
Oregonian is still doing business at the old stand but it
now occupies the entire block. The names of Scott and
Pittock are synonymous with that of the Oregonian.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Journal has taken its place among the foremost
papers of the day and it, too, covers a whole block on its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">12</a></span>
present site. It is a monument to the energy and business
sagacity of Mr. C.&nbsp;S. Jackson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Daily News proved a paying venture and is among
the city&rsquo;s institutions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Sunday Mercury has long since ceased publication
on Sunday, becoming a thriving morning paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Evening Telegram grew so fast that it was compelled
to move to more commodious quarters and occupies
that building once known as the Portland Hotel, which
ceased to be a hostelry in 1953. The Telegram utilizes
the entire building which is proof sufficient of its prosperity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Guide, a little sheet devoted to general information
for the public is still published by a gentleman,
named Stuart, and gives out correct data as in years
gone by.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much of the good in Socialism has been incorporated
in the politics of the state, and the objectionable part of
the doctrines were eschewed. The best ideas of all parties
now enter into politics, which goes to show that there was
good in all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One-half of the police force are women, who dress in
uniform and there is a day shift and a night shift of these
women police, and the idea works well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Owing to sanitary conditions somewhat, but rather to
a change of mind and morals, there is comparatively little
sickness now prevailing in Oregon. Ever since the year
1933, when the State of Oregon passed a bill making it a
criminal offense for anyone to recommend or prescribe
deleterious drugs in the cure of diseases, the number of
doctors using medicines have fallen off and drug stores
are no longer run under that name, and the health of
young and old has wonderfully improved. The science
of curing broken limbs still continues to be practiced but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">13</a></span>
these surgeons acknowledge that drugs and medicines
have lost their potency as a curative agent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Men and women dress very differently from former
days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The tube skirt is surely a thing of the past and pictures
of a 1913 belle dressed in a &lsquo;tube&rsquo; is put on the moving
pictures when it is particularly desirous to raise some
merriment, even if it be done at the expense of one&rsquo;s
great grandmother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The ladies dress in more of an Oriental style which is
very becoming and which allows them more individuality
of design.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The men and boys have gone back to the old Knickerbocker
style of dress and they look very natty in their
new attire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One never sees a horse any more and that species of
animal is well nigh extinct. To be sure, there are some
to be found at the city parks and they are as much
fondled and caressed by the youthful visitor there as was
the pet lamb that Mary took to school. The horses&rsquo; day
as a beast of burden is over, thank God.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are but few of the old stock of Indians left and
these are very proud. Much is being made of them by the
whites, who look up to them as being the &lsquo;First families
of America.&rsquo; Their numbers are few and there is an
effort being exerted to preserve and propagate what is
left of them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is a sprinkle of Chinese and Japanese in the city
but the little people have long since passed the stage of
&lsquo;undesirables.&rsquo; They, too, have had a change of heart
and have stopped all their objectionable ways and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">14</a></span>
become as good citizens as those of the &lsquo;most favored
nation.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Chinamen, more particularly have fallen into the
customs of the white neighbors and a much better feeling
is manifest on both sides, which knocks the dreaded bugaboo
about the &lsquo;yellow peril.&rsquo; Both Japanese and Chinese
affect the American style of dress, even to the knee pants.
Just fancy that!&rdquo;

<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
old lady talked fast now, often stopping for
a minute or so to look at what appeared hieroglyphics
on her memorandum papers:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you that I was 86 years old and the period that
I am talking to you about is just 86 years hence, so that I
am merely looking ahead 86 years instead of looking
backward that length of time. Please do not confound
my subject to the present time for all that I tell you is to
take place in 1999 although I speak of it as having already
occurred. My foresight is just as keen as my hindsight
and all that I am telling you is a reality to me even if it
has not yet actually taken place. But it will happen so,
and just as I relate it to you.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I forgot to tell you that the doctors will be under the
supervision of the City Commissioners. They will be paid
from the city treasury and all fees accruing from the
public for medical service will be paid into the municipal
treasury. The doctors will be paid according to their
ability and civil service examination will be required ere
a doctor will be allowed to practice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All lawyers will have their offices in the court house
and will be assigned to cases as they come up in rotation.
Each attorney must work for the best good of his client
but all cases will have a preliminary examination before a
board of three judges and unless, in their esteem, the
case is a meritorious one, it will be summarily thrown out
of court.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lawyers cannot collect fees from clients but will receive
a salary paid out of the common fund, their emoluments
greatly depending upon the value of their services,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">16</a></span>
the number of cases each has won, etc. This state of
affairs is much appreciated by both practitioner and client
and works well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The ministers, too, come under the supervision of the
City Commission, but as it is impossible for anyone to
tell how many souls they save it has been decided that
their emoluments must come from their clients who are
the better judge of their minister&rsquo;s value.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was in the year 1950 that it became quite observable
that corn, wheat, rye and other cereals entering into the
production of alcohol had lost the power to ferment and
to be converted into beer, wine and whiskey. This was
a startling announcement to the old topers but it was
nevertheless a fact and the science of making alcohol has
become a lost art.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One would think that this would put the distilleries and
breweries out of business, but man is very resourceful
and immediately those in the liquor business began casting
around for a substitute for their former product and
a splendid one was discovered which more than filled all
requirements and now, Weinhard&rsquo;s brewery still managed
by Paul Wessinger the Fourth, and the Gambrinus brewery,
with a Mr. George Leithoff, Jr., at the helm, are
manufacturing a beverage which exhilarates but does not
inebriate. Both of these institutions have grown to five
times the size of the early part of the century and, inasmuch
as there can be no law directed against the sale of
their beverages, there is no license fee exacted by the city
from the cafes or other resorts retailing these wares.
W.&nbsp;J. Van Schuyver &amp; Co., Rothschild Bros., Blumauer,
Hoch &amp; Co., L. Germanus, L. Coblentz &amp; Co., still continue
in business with new faces, the old names are still
on the signs, but they, too, are selling a splendid substitute
for alcoholic beverages.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">17</a></span>
The old lady paused for a minute and with a laugh remarked,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be able to give you of the present
day the recipe for this substitute but it would affect the
gift I possess of foreshadowing the future and I&rsquo;ll have to
leave it a secret.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The lighting of the city is done by one immense electric
light suspended in the air at a height of several thousand
feet which illumines the city as bright as the brightest
day. No deep black shadows are cast as was the case in
former days, but a gentle, steady, pervading light is given
and a person need not have gas fixtures or electric light
fixtures in his home or place of business as the city light
illumines exactly as does the sun.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heat is furnished by the city through a thorough pipe
system and it is compulsory on all citizens to patronize the
city&rsquo;s heat. No fuel in the shape of wood and coal is
used and the loss by fire is nominal and for this reason,
the premiums on fire insurance policies have been cut
down to one-quarter of the former cost. The working
out of this idea has materially helped to beautify the city
and actually put the street cleaning department out of
business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There being so very few horses raised the overplus of
stock feed is used in the propagation of hogs and cattle
and, as a consequence, the meat and milk product has
greatly increased and the prices have been very much
lessened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The disciples of Burbank, the once renowned horticulturist
have been getting busy and as a result many new
fruits and vegetables have been put on the market, their
flavor and excellence outstripping anything known in the
early twentieth century.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We have now one universal, common language. The
vocabulary is not very copious, the dictionary containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">18</a></span>
less than 8,000 words but it is capable of expressing every
idea that the human mind may evolve. This innovation
has made it easy, particularly for the young scholar and
student. Latin and Greek, commonly known as the dead
languages are now very dead, as even the churches have
given up their usage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;High above the clouds at Fort Stevens, is erected a
tower that pierces the sky to several thousand feet, and
far above the cloud line. Here are half a dozen men concontantly
on watch with the latest improved telescopes.
Their mission is to apprize the garrison below of the
approach of an enemy by sea. From their lofty height
and through the modern telescope, ships at a distance of
100 miles at sea can be distinctly sighted and the alarm
given to the ever-watchful garrison.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Signals between the watchers in the lighthouse and the
officers manning the guns indicate the exact location of
the approaching enemy and an attack can be repelled and
the greatest Dreadnaught blown out of the water at this
long range at the will of the gunners. It is in this way
that the entire Pacific Coast is defended, but it is pleasureable
to state, that there has been no semblance of war for
over 50 years and all the earth is at peace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Irrigation in Eastern Oregon and Washington has produced
10 times the amount of wheat formerly raised and
wheat is shipped to all parts of the world from the numerous
and well equipped elevators on the Willamette river.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must now tell you what I consider the greatest of all
the world&rsquo;s inventions and it seems a pity that it has been
bottled up so long merely to line the pockets of a few
sordid railroad owners.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The device was invented in 1925 by a young man
named Wallace Going and it consisted of an apparatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">19</a></span>
which may be so applied to a balloon or other object suspended
in midair, which, when properly adjusted and at a
certain height from the earth, will shake off or cast off the
gravitation of the earth allowing it to suspend in space as
an independent planet. The idea being one of quick transit,
the balloonist after freeing his ship from the earth&rsquo;s attraction
will hang in space till his destination rolls around
to him. The earth moves from west to east, so that it
will take a little more than 20 hours, at this latitude, to
have New York roll around to you, but if you are in New
York it would take but four hours to come to Portland,
provided they are in exactly the same latitude. Do you
understand me? Of course, if you started from Los
Angeles, you would touch some point in the southern
states and if your destination happened to be New York
City, you would have to take the cars to that point. This
has become a favorite way to cross the continent. It is
quick and absolutely without any danger so very few
travel overland by the railroads, that mode of locomotion
being used almost entirely for weighty and bulky merchandise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When young Wallace Going approached the President
of the Transcontinental Railroad with his invention, he
was laughed to scorn, but the young man gave a practical
demonstration ascending in his balloon and allowing the
earth to pass in review before him arriving at Portland
again, or rather, rolling around to Portland again 23
hours 55 minutes later. A vast sum was paid young
Going for his invention, but the railroad companies stuck
to their privilege of bottling it up, fully realizing the revolution
it would create in business once it was established.
The patent ran out in 25 years when the device became
public property and now it is in general use from Alaska
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">20</a></span>
on the north to Terra del Fuego on the south and there
has been very few mishaps to any of the carriers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can see, therefore, how the number of railroads
running north and south must have increased and how
the traffic across the continent has diminished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And still the end of the wonders are not yet,&rdquo; and the
interesting old lady stopped to consult her memorandum
book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will want to know, of course, who are in business
in Portland at the time I am talking about, A.&nbsp;D. 1999,
and I will gladly answer all your enquiries, as I have a
city directory for the year 1998, but it will do for our
use,&rdquo; and the old lady took a ponderous book from her
bag.

  <p class="chapter-title">Old Names Revived.</p>
</div>


<p>&ldquo;<span class="firstWord">Tell</span>
me, please, who are the proprietors of
the department stores in 1999?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there is Lipman, Wolfe &amp; Co., who
occupy two blocks, one at their present location, the other
being on the east side of the river. I notice the name
Ramsdell is still connected with the concern and there are
several Lipmans and Wolfes interested in the business.
They have always kept up with the times and never grew
weary in the race for the golden shekels.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I notice, also, that Meier, Frank Company are not only
in the business at the old stand, but occupy a 50-story
building near where the Multnomah field once was located.
This latter is a grand building and it required a
special act of legislature to effect its construction. The
down town store, which covers an entire block, is devoted
to the heavier and coarser class of merchandise, while the
new store is filled with, well, everything. Here most
of the employes of this great business are comfortably
housed with all the comforts of apartment life and the
huge structure is a little city in itself. This building was
erected as a monument to Messrs. Meier and Frank, the
founders of the house, by their great grand children in
1960.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Olds, Wortman and King are still known by that firm
name and the posterity of each of the individual members
of the house are represented in the business. The store is
conducted on the same broad business principles which
always characterized the founders of the house and which
today makes it the popular place to do shopping.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">22</a></span>
&ldquo;There were other department stores which came and
went, but it seems that these three will &lsquo;go on forever&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is it about the boot and shoe business? Do any
of the old names appear?&rdquo; I queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, there are your old friends, Eggert &amp; Young,
who are still in business but they are away up town on
Twentieth and Washington Streets, which is the centre
of the retail business. The name of Protzman appears,
yes, it is Eugene Protzman, but probably not the one you
know. He is located at Nineteenth and Morrison and
has a nice store.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Rosenthals? Yes, they are doing business at
Twenty-second and Washington, and I notice the name
Friendly often appears in communications from their
store which would indicate that the posterity of the
framers of this business are still connected.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is in the furniture business away off there in
1999?&rdquo; was my next question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You would hardly believe it but there is the old name
of Ira F. Powers, who maintains an immense establishment
on Twelfth and Yamhill Streets. His store is the
largest one of the kind in the city.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then there is Mack &amp; Abrahams whom you knew once
as J.&nbsp;G. Mack &amp; Co., and who were badly burned out
along about 1913. I notice that they buy furniture in
Turkey and other semi-Oriental countries.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about the big stores formerly located on Front
Street, I am very much interested in them, but don&rsquo;t make
your answer read like an ad,&rdquo; I next remarked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about Allen &amp; Lewis for they are yet doing
business, but on a much larger scale. I notice the old
sign has been taken down and carefully covered with a
thick plate glass to preserve it from the elements and it
has been hung back in the same old place and it really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">23</a></span>
looks familiar. They employ an army of men and women
clerks and hundreds of vehicles, mostly flying machines,
to carry their merchandise to their customers. This
business is a monument to the sagacity, honesty, intelligence
and fearlessness of Mr. C.&nbsp;H. Lewis, the founder
of this great house. His memory is still revered by his
own people and those on whom he bestowed kindness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The familiar name of Lang &amp; Co., appears on a large
building on Oak Street, near West Park, the founder of
which was Isador Lang.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is in the printing business off there on the outskirts
of eternity, whose names were once familiar to
me?&rdquo; I queried, as the old lady came to a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there is the name of F.&nbsp;W. Baltes and Company,
who occupy a whole block down near their old
location, and it sounds good to me. There are, too, the
names of J.&nbsp;R. Rogers &amp; Company and Anderson &amp;
Company, but they are located away up town now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about the hotels, please; are there any of the
old land marks left?&rdquo; I queried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very few, if any. You see, the flying machines revolutionized
the hotel business and most of the finest hostelries
are now out of town, several being constructed on
Mt. Tabor, Council Crest and other eminences. The
Multnomah Hotel is still running but the environments
and surroundings have wonderfully changed, the old
wooden buildings have disappeared and commodious,
well-built structures have been erected instead. Space is
too valuable down town for hotels, and the traveling public
demand more suburban locations where there is more
quiet and better air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Clossett &amp; Devers are engaged in business away down
on Front Street, and occupy a whole block and the odors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">24</a></span>
arising from their coffees and spices smell just as sweet
as they did when you passed by their store years ago.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, there is Fleischner, Mayer &amp; Co. They have certainly
kept up with the times generally, being just a little
in the advance so as to set the pace for their competitors.
The business is now being conducted by I.&nbsp;N. Fleischner
the Third, M.&nbsp;M. Fleischner the Third, Sol and Sanford
Hirsch, Mark Mayer the Third. There are grand nephews
of Sam Simon connected with the firm and the old names
are much in evidence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the insurance business, I notice we have some of the
old names yet. There is James Peter Moffatt, Jr., Rosenblatt
Bros., J.&nbsp;D. Wilcox, Jr., John H. Burgard III., J.
McI. Wood, L. Samuel III, Henry Hewitt, Edward Hall,
F.&nbsp;E. Hart, Thos. Jordan, F.&nbsp;J. Alex Mayer, Frank
Motter, Harvey O&rsquo;Brien. It is remarkable how the sons
of professional men follow in the footsteps of their
fathers&rsquo; business. There is Erskine Wood, who must be
a great grandson of Mr. C.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;S. Wood, Robert Strong
Sargent, undoubtedly the branch of Harry K. Sargent.
Dan J. Malarkey, Jr., the grandson of our Dan. Russell
Sewall, whose grandfather you knew well. P.&nbsp;J. Bannon,
nephew to our own Mr. Bannon. Henry E. McGinn, who
is none other than the grand nephew of Judge H.&nbsp;E.
McGinn of the Circuit Court, the most wideawake, fearless
exponent of good law in the state, I find the names of
M. C. George III, John F. Logan, a grandson of our
John. John Ditchburn, once known as &lsquo;Honest John,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Gentleman John,&rsquo; whose name is among the attorneys
of 1999. Here is a list of the rest of these attorneys:
J.&nbsp;D. Mann, Chester Murphy, W.&nbsp;D. Fenton, Walter
Hayes, John Manning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All these are very familiar names to you and they all
appear in the telephone directory for 1999, but I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">25</a></span>
give you a few more whom you will remember, and the
old lady read off the following list which sounded good
to me: John Beck, Whitney Boise, Geo. Brice, Bronaugh,
Citron, D.&nbsp;S. Cohen, Craib, Dolph, Mallory, Duniway,
Emmons, Ferrera, Fouts, Carey, Gleason, Glisan, Hogue,
Green, Hazen, Holman, Hume, C.&nbsp;M. Idleman, Languth,
Logan, Wallace McCamant, McDevitt, L. A. McNary,
Moody, Morris, G. C. Moser, Munley, Olsen, Pague,
Pipes, F.&nbsp;J. Richardson, Giltner, Chas. J. Schnabel, Shillock,
Zera Snow, S. Raynor, Stott, Sweek, Swope, Jos. N.
Teal, Upton, Vaughn, Webster, Whalley, Whitfield, Williams,
Ryan, Thos. O&rsquo;Day, Tazwell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must interrupt the routine to tell you something
about the innovation in barbering,&rdquo; remarked the old
lady, reaching for a paper in her pocketbook.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, it occurred in A.&nbsp;D. 1951, that an old
chemist made a discovery. He ascertained that by a concoction
of sage, sulphur and some other ingredients hair
can be removed from the face efficaciously and as clean as
a barber could shave you. The preparation was made up
into some kind of a soap and the lather applied to the
whiskers and allowed to remain for three minutes when it
was washed off with clean water. This process removed
hair from the face without injury to the skin, doing away
entirely with the services of a tonsorial artist. It is a
wonderful discovery, but it had the bad effect of putting
a number of good men out of business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder how this discovery affected my friend,
Frank Rogers?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;this occurred in 1951 and I
expect that Frank was not caring much for the barber
business then, as he got rich in the business prior to that
time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">26</a></span>
Continuing, the old lady said, &ldquo;There are now not any
more tonsorial apartments than existed in A.&nbsp;D. 1913 and
the sphere of usefulness of that kind of talent is confined
to hair cutting, massaging and such like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The world wags on. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued my visitor,
&ldquo;you can leave your measure for a pair of shoes to order
and you may come back in 10 minutes and find them all
ready to take away with you. The same can be said
about getting a suit of clothes which takes just 60 minutes
to construct and be ready for wear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in the banking business that I know, away off
there on the verge of time?&rdquo; I asked of my companion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there are many whom you know,&rdquo; was her reply.
&ldquo;At least, you will remember the names of many. Ladd
&amp; Tilton still conduct their business and I notice a number
of the name of Ladd connected with the institution as I
take it that the estate is still in the banking business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then there is First National Bank with many familiar
names like Corbett, Failing, Alvord, Newkirk, which indicates
that the new generation are a branch of the former
tree.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I notice that the Security &amp; Trust Company have officials
bearing the names of Adams, Jubitz, Lee and
others, but as they are all young men, they must be a
later generation than you know. The same is the case
with the United States National Bank, where the present
officials bear such names as Ainsworth, Barnes and
Schmeer. Yes, new generation, too. We have the Merchants&rsquo;
National Bank, Durhams, Hoyts, Watson&rsquo;s can
be heard giving instructions from the different desks but
they, too, don&rsquo;t belong to your time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady was getting to the end of her memorandums,
but she still had lots to tell and talk about.
</p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">27</a></span>
&ldquo;I notice,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that the first class buildings
like the Yeon, the Wilcox, the old Oregonian, the Spalding,
the Journal, the Commercial Club and many others
of the buildings that you know about are still in fine repair
and have stood the ravages of time very well, but
our climate deals gently with well-constructed buildings
and if care is taken, they will last a long time yet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Pittock building, erected on Mr. Pittock&rsquo;s old
home site, is as beautiful as it was the day it was erected
and it is certainly a credit to the city.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Elks&rsquo; building which covers a full block, is further
out on Washington Street and is a beautiful structure.
Many elks heads adorn the walls of the lodge room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Selling building at the corner of Sixth and Alder
still stands and is in fine condition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The firm of Morgan, Fliedner &amp; Boyce, erected many
handsome buildings, one, particularly, in the north end,
being a wonder. Joseph Boyce&rsquo;s name appears in the
telephone directory, probably a descendant of one of the
members of that firm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I notice that in all cases that it is a matter of the &lsquo;survival
of the fittest,&rsquo; and the names of the old people whose
descendants are in business were noted in 1913 for their
honesty and integrity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sig. Sichel &amp; Co. is a familiar sign around town,
evidently the &lsquo;Footprints on the sands of time,&rsquo; achieved
by our old friend, Sig. Sichel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The name of Ben Selling can be seen at half a dozen
different stores in various parts of the city.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The name of W.&nbsp;P. Friedlander is to be seen over a
jewelry store on Washington Street, near Sixth, evidently
the descendants of the former popular jeweler.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Another old timer&rsquo;s name, L.&nbsp;C. Henrichsen, appears
over a jewelry store further up on Washington Street,
the proprietors of which are the great grandchildren of
the merchant of 1913.&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;<span class="firstWord">I want</span>
to tell you a joke which I heard the other
day that has come thundering down the ages of
time and which is told about Theodore B. Wilcox
when he was cashier of Ladd &amp; Tilton&rsquo;s Bank, somewhere
in the 1880&rsquo;s. This will go to show you that people may
forget their Bible lessons but they never fail to remember
a joke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Frenchman appeared at the depository at First and
Stark Streets one day with a check for $750, payable to
Jean Crapo. Mr. Wilcox told the Frenchman that he
must be identified before he could draw the money.
&lsquo;Identified, identified. I don&rsquo;t know what that means,&rsquo;
exclaimed the Frenchman. When it was explained to him
he said, &lsquo;Oh, I comprenez,&rsquo; and producing a photograph
of himself from his side pocket, he triumphantly informed
Mr. Wilcox that he thought this would be sufficient identification.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I remember that story. It was told by
Jerry Coldwell in the columns of the Oregonian, and it is
hard to believe that people are smiling over the story 120
years later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Another story is told of C.&nbsp;A. Malarkey,&rdquo; continued
the visitor, &ldquo;and I will relate it:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Charley was visiting in San Francisco and put up at
the Palace Hotel. A darkey had driven him around in
his carriage viewing the city all one afternoon and as the
dinner hour approached, the cab was about to be discharged
when Charley remembered that he needed some
neckwear and told the driver to take him to a haberdasher.
The darkey drove around several blocks finally stopping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">29</a></span>
to ask, &lsquo;Where did you say you wanted to go, boss?&rsquo; &lsquo;I
want to go to a haberdasher,&rsquo; he replied, and the driver
started off again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He drove around seven or eight blocks, then dismounted,
and in an apologetical tone said, &lsquo;Look hyar,
sah, Ise driven this hyar hack for 22 years and neber gib
anyone away yet; you just tell me whare it is yer want
to go, sah, and Ise de boy that can take yer there.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand that this anecdote was told the other
night at one of the popular lodges under the head of &lsquo;good
of the order&rsquo;,&rdquo; and the old lady proceeded to look still
further into her portmanteau for other items of interest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;what is the force and energy used
in producing electricity? They must have found more
power for there is so much of it used.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; responded the old lady, &ldquo;If you remember,
there was a movement on foot away back in 1905 to harness
the ocean&rsquo;s waves, but it was determined to be unfeasible.
Later on, it was demonstrated that the project
was a simple one and now the highway to the ocean is
lined with poles carrying power developed by the ocean
waves which gives an endless and inexhaustible supply
and which is cheap and always reliable. This means of
securing power is utilized the entire length of the Pacific
Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and on all the Great Lakes, Chicago
being the first city to try the experiment from the
waters of Lake Michigan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This discovery has had the good effect of making it
possible to properly conserve the nation&rsquo;s water supply and
has created a new industry. Irrigation by means of huge
air tanks filled with water and allowed to rain upon
parched spots is the present method of irrigating and it
works wondrously well.&rdquo;

<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
little old lady began to chuckle to herself
and explained the occasion for her hilarity.
She was reminded of some more stories which
she would relate after she read me a few more of the
signs that could be seen on Morrison Street in A.&nbsp;D.
1999.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is Jaeger Brothers, jewelers, G. Heitkemper, in
the same business. Buffum &amp; Pendleton&rsquo;s kin are located
on Morrison Street and are conducting a general hat and
clothing store.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The name Honeyman is quite in evidence in various
parts of the city whose antecedents are old Portland stock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The name Gill is seen in three different parts of the
city, and all are engaged in the book and stationery business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;L. Mayer&rsquo;s descendants are engaged in a wholesale
grocery business away up town and are prosperous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harold Von Stein Hansen is an enthusiastic leader of
the Socialist party, his great grandfather being one of
the leaders of that party in the early 1900&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are a couple of gentlemen in business whose
progenitors were favorably known. I refer to Messrs.
Kraner &amp; Stose, whose names appear on a sign on Morrison
Street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Strange to say Broadway is the leading street of the
city. The cutting away of the Seventh Street hill and the
three bridges connecting Portland with the State of Washington
has been a factor in the upbuilding of this thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Many newcomers are in business on this street and the
names would be strange to you.&rdquo;

  </div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">By</span>
this time, the old lady had finished her memoranda,
and she now produced a small book which
seemed to contain much data.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not tried to adopt any system in regaling you
with my story, but have taken it up by piece-meal, believing
that it would be of more interest and, if you do not
object, I will continue in the same way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I assured her that I was very deeply interested and that
the story would be received with much delight by all and
begged that she proceed in her own good way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For 50 years prior to the present date, the subject of
cremation has been vigorously discussed both by press
and pulpit and now the people are ready to give up their
ancient pagan ideas of burying the dead and have adopted
the cleaner, and more economical method of cremation.
Cemeteries have been turned into play grounds, tombstones
removed and no vestige of the former gruesome
abode of the dead is visible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This new order of disposing of those who have passed
away was at first very bitterly opposed by members of
some of the orthodox churches, but the innovation was
finally conceded to be right and that it did not conflict
with the teachings of any church and it has become the
general custom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A favorite way of disposing of the ashes is to take
them up in an air vehicle out over the Pacific Ocean
where the urn is emptied and the ashes carried away by
the four winds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is strange how some people want the whole earth
and would like to have it fenced off,&rdquo; pursued the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">32</a></span>
lady. &ldquo;When the science of practical, safe and easy air
travel became fully demonstrated some property owners
had the audacity to erect a sign on their buildings warning
all flying machines from trespassing over their
property.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One prominent lawyer who owns property down on
First Street was one who objected to having his space
invaded by flying machines. He was asked how high in
the air he owned and replied, &lsquo;Clear up to the sky.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In carrying out this idea, a railroad company recently
petitioned the City Commissioners to give them an undisturbed
and sole privilege of all space in the air up
Seventh Street from the height of 100 feet to 500 feet
and excluding all other air vehicles from trespassing on
this &lsquo;right of way&rsquo; up Seventh to Grant and over the
Broadway bridge. I am glad to say the City Commissioners
declined this arbitrary spoliation of God&rsquo;s free
air and the franchise was refused.&rdquo;

<p>
<span class="firstWord">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d</span>
like to know a little something about the politics
of the city and state,&rdquo; I remarked, as the little old
woman came to a halt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there is lots to tell you about that,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Take it, for instance, we are going to have an election for
governor next year, in A.&nbsp;D. 2000, and there are but two
tickets in the field, one is the Progressives and the other
the Socialists.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A man named Dan Kellaher is candidate on the Progressive
ticket and I think he is connected with the famous
Dan Kellaher of the early 1900&rsquo;s, but,&rdquo; and here the
old lady smiled, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t think that he will be elected and
one reason is because he fails to be able to demonstrate or
tell his constituents how it is possible for a man to ride 67
miles for 5 cents by the transfer system over a metropolitan
street car line.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ralph Clyde, grandson of the boy who did not get appointed
candy inspector, because his father was not
elected City Commissioner in 1913, is running for Governor
on the Socialist ticket and everybody in the state is
aware that he is in the race, judging from the stacks of
printing turned out at his grandfather&rsquo;s office bearing
his slogan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I notice that the name of Nat Bird appears as a candidate
for sheriff, but that very same thing has been going
on for 125 years and I could not tell if he is the fourth
or fifth of that generation, aspiring for the same office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not considered good form for anyone to propose
himself for office any more and it is rather the idea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">34</a></span>
the office seeking the man more than it is the man running
after the office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Billiard and pool tables continue to be a favorite pastime
with the young man around town, but ivory balls are
no longer available on account of the scarcity of elephants
which makes the use of ivory as billiard balls prohibitive.
A very good substitute, however, has been found to take
the place of the ivory ball.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I notice that the Oregonian came out a few days ago
and asked the question as to who were the three greatest
presidents and who do you think the preponderance of
opinion fell to? I&rsquo;ll tell you. Washington, of course,
was the first, always first in war, etc. Then Lincoln was
second and Grover Cleveland was third. I tell you this
will greatly interest your people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I forgot to tell you that we had a heavenly visitor recently.
No, it was not the reincarnation of any of the
Apostles, but just another visit from Halley&rsquo;s comet. It
occurred about 1985 and was a very brilliant affair. Some
of the oldest inhabitants remembered hearing their grandparents
telling of the appearance of a comet along about
1910 and files of the Oregonian of that year were produced
showing photographs of Halley&rsquo;s comet as it appeared
in that year and a prophecy that it would come
again in 75 years. There being well-founded proofs of
its previous harmless appearance, the comet did not disturb
the people and its visit was enjoyed and all were
sorry that they would in all probability never see it again
as its next scheduled time is A.&nbsp;D. 2060.&rdquo;

<div class="poem">
<p class="left15">&ldquo;Henceforth my heart shall sigh no more,</p>
<p class="left20">For olden times and holier shore,</p>
<p class="left20">God&rsquo;s love and blessing then and there,</p>

</div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">&ldquo;I must</span>
tell you of several most wonderful occurrences
which have taken place since 1913,&rdquo; continued
the old lady looking at some papers which
she held in her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was deemed necessary, about the year 1951 to increase
the water supply for the City of Portland and it
was ascertained that the conditions at Mount Hood forbade
looking to that place for a greater supply and it was
decided to utilize the, as yet, great and untouched
abundance of water offered by Mount St. Helens, and
three years later the pipe line was completed, and water
from beautiful St. Helens was turned into the new and
immense reservoirs constructed for the ever-increasing
population.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was fortunate for the city that this new supply was
projected and consummated just at this time for it was
but a year later that Mt. Hood, which had been &lsquo;groaning&rsquo;
for some time began to belch forth from its intestines
a mass of smoke and lava which bared the mountain
of snow and caused much consternation among our
people. The volcano continued active for several weeks,
at intervals, finally entirely subsiding and it has been on
its good behavior now for 25 years. Repairs were made
to the pipe line and Portland, today, is getting a portion
of its water supply from Mt. Hood as of yore.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">36</a></span>
&ldquo;The radical changes in the methods of railroading have
caused a new era in locomotion and rolling stock. Steam
gave way to gasoline and that energy to electricity which
held sway for a long time only to be replaced by a newer
power, which is not as yet given out to the public.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The O. W. R. &amp; N. Company now occupy a building
of their own, 20 stories high, and I notice the names of
Cotton, Sutherland, O&rsquo;Brien, Campbell, Buckley, Klippel,
are still on the official list, all of whom are descendants
of the officials who served the company earlier in the
century.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The old Wells, Fargo &amp; Company&rsquo;s building still
stands and that express company occupies the entire structure
with no rooms to spare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Hasty Messenger &amp; Express Company, founded
in 1899, is celebrating its 100th anniversary, its manager
being Napoleon Traverso, whose progenitor was connected
with the company in 1910.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There has been a wonderful improvement in the present-day
typewriters. As I mentioned earlier in my story,
there is now a universal language with but 8,000 words.
Of this number about 1,000 is all sufficient for an ordinary
person and the genius of the inventor has reduced
to a combination these 1,000 words in such a manner,
that it is possible for a good operator to copy a sermon,
or lecture, with ease, on the typewriter, from the most
rapid talking orator.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The sphere of usefulness of the phonograph has widened
and it is now &lsquo;A thing of joy forever.&rsquo; It seems
that this splendid instrument is now gifted with almost
human intelligence. Take for instance, an item cut from
a daily paper and paste it on the cylinder, or disc, and
without further preparation, a voice will read off the item
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">37</a></span>
to you in a plain, clear tone. Paste on the disc, the &lsquo;Index
of today&rsquo;s news&rsquo; from your morning paper and start
it going and the items are read off to you correctly and
in good voice. Do you wonder then that I call this a
great age?&rdquo; and a pleased smile came to the old lady&rsquo;s
countenance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Many splendid brains have been working to better the
methods and increase the value and usage of the telephone,
and one must &lsquo;hit the ball and hit it all the time&rsquo;
to be able to hold an official position with a telephone
company. The result of these efforts have put the telephone
to varied uses. You can now, not only talk to a
person over a wire, but you can actually see them, life
size and just as they are, exactly as if you were talking
to them face to face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Telephones are everywhere, but there are no longer
any &lsquo;Centrals&rsquo; and no more &lsquo;Number, please,&rsquo; is heard,
that system becoming unpopular about 1925. Public
telephones are established on each street corner, where
one may call up, talk to and see the person who answers
the phone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much telephoning is now being done by wireless and
that branch of the service has developed greatly and is
used to communicate with aerial vehicles. This service
has been perfected, many former objectionable features
being eliminated or overcome.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am about to relate an occurrence which is by far the
most wonderful I have yet told and it is a phenomena
which startled the world, making the superstitious quake,
and bringing alarm to many nervous people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know that it was in 1912 that the ill-fated Captain
Scott planted the flag at the South Pole, losing his valuable
life in the &lsquo;get away.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">38</a></span>
&ldquo;Ice was forming at the South Pole, each year encroaching
more and more towards the north and some
alleged scientific men predicted that the time would surely
come when the ice deposit at the South Pole would become
so great and the weight so heavy, that it would
result in throwing the earth off its present axis, probably
tipping up old Mother Earth and reversing the positions
of the Equator and the Poles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As the century rolled on this doctrine became much
talked about and many extravagant speculations were
made as to the exact time when the catastrophe would
take place, the most advantageous country to emigrate to
in order to insure safety, and business generally was much
disturbed. It was difficult to sell or hypothecate any real
estate, and money and jewels were considered of doubtful
value. Continued cold weather, far into the summer
months, was the usual occurrence for several years and
devastating rains fell upon the earth. Street preaching
was the order of the day, and at every corner an earnest
man or woman held an interested crowd discussing the
Last Day, which they assured the listeners was near at
hand. Many people gave away their entire worldly possessions
and essayed to get their soul ready for its eternal
flight. As the days passed by the excitement increased,
and aerial voyages to the South Pole were planned and
executed by thousands of people in their air machines. In
former days it was a fad to take a trip around the world
latitudinally, but now all these tourists wanted to go the
other way of the stuff, and make the journey longitudinally,
crossing the Frigid, Temperate and Torrid zones,
North and South poles, and the journey was completed,
by some, in less than 20 days. The reports given out by
these travelers were not encouraging and much distress
of mind was manifest.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">39</a></span>
&ldquo;One day a report came that the South Pole was in
process of eruption and that the ice was beginning to
move. This announcement spread dismay on all sides,
many now accepting the evil prognostications as being
true, and the excitement was intense. The street preaching
became more general but this merely increased the
agitation. One preacher, a benevolent looking gentleman,
who was very much at ease during all this disturbing
period, seemed to be able to quiet the fears of the people
by simply stating that God was present everywhere, and
he would sing a hymn with that title. His singing and
talks were very comforting to many who listened to his
words and they patiently waited for what was to come.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The eruptions continued and every day or two more
volcanoes appeared, throwing up steam and lava, breaking
up and displacing the ice which now began to move
Northward. The huge mass was reported to look very
threatening and the many photographs taken of the
phenomena only produced more excitement. For days
this situation continued, and now the ice was fast disappearing
at the South Pole and it was also melting in the
ocean as it proceeded north to the fiftieth degree. Disastrous
storms ensued and the Western hemisphere was
deluged, but the ice was melting rapidly under the fire of
a dozen active volcanoes. Reports from the South Pole
were growing more encouraging and people were again
taking heart when, one day, the Department of the Interior
announced that all danger was over. Then there
was rejoicing, the like of which never before shook the
earth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, the return to common sense was marked by
many humorous occurrences. The people who showed
the most trepidation and who gave away all their earthly
possessions, played the Indian act and wanted their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_040" id="Page_040">40</a></span>
presents back. Many said they were glad to begin all
over again to accumulate worldly goods and the person
who was thanked the most was he who had preached of
the Omnipresence of God.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A wonderful lesson had been taught everybody and
that epoch marked the beginning of a truer brotherhood
among mankind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old lady paused, and, heaving a sigh, exclaimed,
&ldquo;And, now my story is done. I have tried to illustrate the
utter uselessness of borrowing trouble and being apprehensive
without reason. I would like to have you tell
your readers that it is my advice to heed the words of the
poet prophet, &lsquo;Rest in the Lord, and He will give thee
thy heart&rsquo;s desire.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is my name, you ask?&rdquo; here the old lady sighed
again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot tell you now, but some day you will know. I
hope I have fulfilled my mission and accomplished some
good.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In leaving you I would like you to remember:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="left15">&ldquo;That all of good the past hath had,</p>

  <h3><a href="#linkTOC09"
  title="Link to the table of contents.">The
  Bad Man From Bodie.</a></h3>
</div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">It was</span>
not a prepossessing face that entered Jack
Hamlin&rsquo;s office one morning in Bodie, California.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, young fellow, my name is Jim Slack, and
I want ter talk ter you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, go ahead, and I&rsquo;ll try and be a cheerful listener,&rdquo;
responded Jack.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a pardner and it struck me that you&rsquo;d
be the right feller for the job,&rdquo; and the visitor tried to
smile a persuasive smile, but the attempt was a failure.
The scar which began at his ear and extended down to
his throat was unbecoming, and his right ear which
looked as if a bite had been taken from it gave his head
a one-sided appearance. His eyes possessed a shifty, uncertain
look, his beard was of a reddish hue and two
weeks&rsquo; growth. His clothes were ragged, ill-fitting and
dirty.
</p>

<p>
Fastidious Jack Hamlin took his visitor in at a glance
and laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;d like me for a partner, would you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I heard as how you were a spikilator like, and I
want ter give yer a chance ter git rich quick.&rdquo; He continued,
&ldquo;I am the owner of some of the most valyable
claims in the Lundy deestrict; I own the Sheepherder, the
Dutchman, the Julia Lundy and some other valyable
prospects. I want yer to grub stake me and one-half of
all I own is yers.&rdquo; Here the visitor gave Jack a furtive
side glance, but presently looked away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So, I have the pleasure of talking to the honorable
James Slack of whom I have heard so much and I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">044</a></span>
further honored by being invited to become his partner,
for the mere pittance of a grub stake?&rdquo; And Jack laughed
a merry laugh which did not please Slack. &ldquo;You are the
man that has several scalps already attached to your belt
and you&rsquo;d probably like to add mine to the collection,
eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jim Slack winced under these insinuations, but he was
hungry and he diplomatically kept his temper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those were all accidents and they never could prove
it different,&rdquo; sullenly replied Slack. &ldquo;I did not come here
to be joshed, but ter give yer a chance ter get rich quick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very kind, indeed; here, take this and go and get a
square meal, I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy that,&rdquo; and Jack tossed a
gold piece to his caller. &ldquo;Come again and we&rsquo;ll talk the
matter over,&rdquo; and Jack returned to his work.
</p>

<p>
Jim Slack was probably the worst character in Mono
county. He had been suspected of stage robbery, but so
clever was his disguise that he could not be convicted.
It was known that he had killed three men, an Irishman,
a German, and a Chinaman, but he managed to save his
neck through some legal quibble. When he was drinking,
he would become almost a demon and assail friend or
foe, if thwarted.
</p>

<p>
Jack Hamlin had made several thousand dollars about
this time in mining speculations, and the money troubled
him. He was never cut out to be an accumulator and
money burnt a hole in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll take a chance with you,&rdquo; he said, when
Slack returned, &ldquo;but I want a straight out and out deal.
Go over and have Tom Stephens draw up the papers and
I&rsquo;ll arrange the credit for you at the store.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No time was lost by Slack in obeying orders, and the
next morning he started for his mines in the high Sierras
with an outfit, the like of which he never before enjoyed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">45</a></span>
He swore everlasting fealty to Hamlin, but the latter
waived all this &ldquo;cheap talk,&rdquo; as he called it, telling Slack
he expected to hear good reports from him.
</p>

<p>
Two months passed by, and a visit was projected by
his new partner to Slack&rsquo;s mines. The latter came down
from his eyrie, the twain meeting at Lundy, a little camp
at the base of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
In drawing up the contract, Jim Slack had agreed to
cut out liquor, and much stress was placed upon this part
of the agreement.
</p>

<p>
It was quite late in the evening when Jack and his comrade
started up the mountain for the mines. The location
was far above the timber belt and in a spot of almost everlasting
snow.
</p>

<p>
It was too dark to make any inspection of the mines
that evening and a log fire was speedily burning for the
weather was very cold on this July evening.
</p>

<p>
The bed was uninviting, composed mostly of wild
beasts&rsquo; skins, the odor of which was strong and lingering.
</p>

<p>
To Jack&rsquo;s surprise the first act of his host was to
produce a whiskey bottle which he placed to his mouth,
taking a long swig, offering the same to Hamlin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your brand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good shot, that leaves the more for me,&rdquo; and the
miner took another big swig.
</p>

<p>
Quiet reigned for a few minutes, when suddenly, with
a demoniacal yell, Slack drew his gun and aiming it at
one of the windows, emptied the six shots in as many
seconds, crying out, &ldquo;I got him then, didn&rsquo;t you see him?
It was Paddy Mann, whom they say I killed last year.
There, I saw him tumble over the cliff,&rdquo; and the now
thoroughly drunken man shrieked with laughter.
</p>

<p>
Another libation was indulged in, and looking at the
other window Slack shuddered, exclaiming, &ldquo;Ah, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">46</a></span>
the Dutchman after me; what does he want? Let me
take a pop at him,&rdquo; and again was the revolver emptied
into the window, provoking much maudlin merriment
from the gunner.
</p>

<p>
Hamlin laid quietly in bed all this time, feeling a sense
of more security by so doing, but on the alert with his
own gun if it became necessary to defend himself.
</p>

<p>
The bottle was again produced and the liquor went
gurgling down Slack&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;That was Hans Schmidt
that I finished. What was he doing around here, do you
suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on, hold on,&rdquo; he shrieked, &ldquo;here comes Ah Lim,
the Chinaman, I can see him dodging behind the rocks;
let me go out and pepper him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Six shots again rang out in the air, and throwing himself
on the ill-smelling bed, Slack pulled one of the skins
over his head to shut out the gruesome sight his imagination
had conjured up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That Chinaman ought to know better &rsquo;n to come round
this yere cabin. I told him so, but he, too, has fallen
over the slide and I&rsquo;ll never be bothered by him. They
been coming purty thick tonight, but I&rsquo;ve done a good
job, and now I&rsquo;ll have another drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The big bottle was nearly emptied and Slack again
threw himself on the bed, apparently oblivious of Jack&rsquo;s
presence.
</p>

<p>
After a few moments of quiet, the drunken man fell
into a stupor, snoring heavily. Hamlin saw his chance
to escape, but he realized that he was taking desperate
chances. Were he to inadvertantly awaken the sleeper,
he might be number four.
</p>

<p>
Patiently waiting till the sleeper gave evidence of being
soundly at rest, he made for the door, which he quickly
opened and passed out, hastening with all speed for the
friendly timber a quarter of a mile away.
</p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">47</a></span>
The night was clear, the moon shining brightly, like it
does in the lofty Sierra Nevada Mountains, and Jack had
reached the timber belt, when an awful shriek rang out
upon the air, followed immediately by six rapidly fired
shots. Looking backward, the tall form of Jim Slack
could be seen coming down the snowy trail, and Jack
accelerated his own speed. Again and again did the pursuer
empty his revolver at the fleeing Hamlin, who could
not hold his distance against this man of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
The forest was growing thicker, and Jack saw his only
chance for escape was to hide from his pursuer, so dodged
quickly behind a huge fir tree, just as a sharp bend was
made in the road.
</p>

<p>
With bated breath he waited the coming of his pursuer
who passed by three minutes later, gun in hand and
shrieking and cursing like a demon.
</p>

<p>
Jack watched him, following him as closely as he dared,
till the little camp of Lundy was reached.
</p>

<p>
Slack pursued his way to the hotel bar room, which was
crowded with the usual habitues.
</p>

<p>
It will always remain a mystery as to how the affair
happened, but it is said that Jim Slack opened fire on his
old enemy, Ed Clancy, who retreated, only to reappear
in the rear, where he poured a volley into Slack. The
latter fell, and, standing over the dying man, Clancy
emptied his second gun into the prostrate body.
</p>

<p>
The magistrate of the camp was a witness of the killing,
and promptly exonerated Clancy from any blame.
</p>

<p>
The following telegram was put on the wires immediately
for the San Francisco papers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;James Slack, widely known as the &lsquo;Bad man from
Bodie,&rsquo; was killed in a pistol fight tonight by Edward
Clancy. The killing was justifiable. Slack has relatives
in San Francisco.&rdquo;
</p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">48</a></span>
About noon on the following day a message was received
by the postmaster of Lundy reading:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;San Francisco, California, July 15.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Please take care of James Slack&rsquo;s body till my arrival.
I come on first train.</p>

<p class="closing">Signed, His Mother.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Four days later, the lumbering stage coach drew up in
front of the hotel, and a little, old lady alighted. She
was modestly attired and possessed a sweet, gentle face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am Mrs. Slack, the mother of James Slack, the man
who was killed a few days ago. Where will I find his
remains?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Every hat was doffed as the old lady passed out into
the back room where laid all there was of James Slack.
</p>

<p>
There were no tears in her eyes as she stooped down
and kissed the dead man on the forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor little Jimmie,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;my poor
little Jimmie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was decided to bury the remains at Lundy and a
grave had already been dug for that purpose, over which
some heartless fellow had placed a head board, bearing
the following inscription:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jim Slack, the toughest cuss in all Mono diggin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This here don&rsquo;t go, I tell yer,&rdquo; said big Bill Hall, the
hotel man, &ldquo;and this is what I&rsquo;ll do with sich a board,&rdquo;
and seizing it threw it over the Geiger grade, where it
went clankety, clankety, clankety, down 2,000 feet to the
creek below.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who can sing a hymn in this here crowd?&rdquo; enquired
Bill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I used ter know a couple of hymns when I went to
Sunday School,&rdquo; ventured Dick Byzicks, and one or two
others owned up that they, too, knew a hymn or two and
the volunteers stepped to the side of the woods to rehearse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">49</a></span>
It was an unusually quiet day in Lundy. The bar room
was closed, the first time in its history. Heads were uncovered
as the little cortege proceeded slowly from the
hotel to the newly made grave. Jack Hamlin walked
with the little mother. A quartette of pretty fair voices
sang &ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nearer My God to Thee.&rdquo;
Hamlin read a few passages from the only Bible in camp
and the body was laid at rest.
</p>

<p>
A representative from the May Lundy mine, whose
stockholders lived in Calais, Maine, called on Mrs. Slack,
offering her $10,000 for her son&rsquo;s prospects, and after a
little negotiation, the deal, was consummated, Jack Hamlin
generously waiving his partnership rights in favor of
Mrs. Slack.
</p>

<p>
A little marble monument marks the last resting place
of Jim Slack, which bears the following legend and no
mark of disrespect has ever been shown the grave:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sacred to the memory of James Slack, who died July
15th, A.&nbsp;D. 18&mdash;. Erected by his mother, who always
loved her son.&rdquo;

Story telling was in order, and as most of the guests
present had traveled a good deal in their time, the tales
told covered every known topic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know something about &lsquo;Bogy,&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed
George Eubanks, an erstwhile telegraph man and now a
banker of Ashland. &ldquo;I have heard so much about
&lsquo;Bogy&rsquo;s&rsquo; great ability, but have never heard it corroborated.
Can anyone present tell me if it is really so that
he could copy 50 words behind, all night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; was a character whose real name was Henry
Bogardus, and he was one of those itinerant operators
who are never content to remain in any one place more
than a week. He made annual pilgrimages to the Pacific,
and in his peregrinations would become acquainted with
most every railroad operator on the roads that he traversed.
&ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; had a way of convincing these humble
knights of the key that he was a most extraordinary
operator which impression assisted him materially in
evading the inter-state commerce bill.
</p>

<p>
It was up to the writer to tell a story about &ldquo;Bogy,&rdquo; as
he had seen him later than any of the rest of the assemblage.
</p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">52</a></span>
About the year 1893, &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; arrived in Portland, and
straightway appealed to the telegraph manager for a loan
of $1, which was speedily forthcoming, for nobody could
refuse &ldquo;Bogy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An hour or so later, he repaired to the operating
room, where he sat down to the Walla Walla wire, proceeding
to get off business on the double quick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who sent for you and what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; queried
the chief operator.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, young fellow, I&rsquo;m Bogy, and I
refer you to our manager,&rdquo; and the imperturbable artist
proceeded sending to Walla Walla.
</p>

<p>
The manager informed the chief that &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; was all
right, that if he did no good he would do no harm, and
to let him continue his work.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; worked all day and evening and clear up into
the night, only stopping when there was nothing left for
him to do.
</p>

<p>
The soft side of a bench was a tempting bed for this
weary traveler, and, as he liked to sleep near the tick of
the telegraph instruments, permission was granted him to
take the bench into the battery room.
</p>

<p>
Several days slipped by, &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; working night and day.
He certainly enjoyed working; it was a pastime with him.
</p>

<p>
Saturday came, and with it the usual pay-day and
&ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; received his emoluments with the rest of the men.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you on at 6 P.&nbsp;M. tonight,&rdquo; said the chief
operator, &ldquo;you will take the Associated Press news tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here when the clock strikes 6 and I&rsquo;m going to
show you something in the line of telegraphing the like
of which has never been performed here before,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; assumed a very important air.
</p>

<p>
He was on hand promptly and sat down to the San
Francisco wire, where Billy Williamson was displaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">53</a></span>
his musical Morse. It was coming very fast, but beautiful
as an opera to listen to.
</p>

<p>
Picking up the manifold sheets, he discovered the carbons
were not straight and he began to adjust them, San
Francisco sending right along.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; began the night chief, &ldquo;when are you going to
start in to copy? You are now 100 words behind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cease from annoying me, I often copy 300 and 400
words behind. Now, just wait till I locate my stylus and
I&rsquo;ll show you what no other man can do,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo;
began a search for the missing article.
</p>

<p>
Williamson had now sent two full sheets and the night
chief was very nervous fearing an unlooked for denouement,
but &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; was impassive.
</p>

<p>
The missing stylus was at last found and &ldquo;he&rdquo; squared
himself for his grand feat, much to the relief of the very
much excited night chief. Fully 400 words had now been
sent but &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; looked wise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, my boy,&rdquo; addressing the night chief, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
out for a few minutes, but let him send just the same. I&rsquo;ll
keep it all in my head till I get back, and when I return
you will see something in the way of telegraphing that
you never dreamed of before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Saying this, &ldquo;Bogy&rdquo; went out into the dark and&mdash;never
returned.

  </p>
  <h3><a href="#linkTOC12" title="Link to the table of contents.">Where Did You Get That Oil?</a></h3>
  </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
firm of Kelly, Dunne &amp; Co. were doing
business a quarter of a century ago, and the
junior member of that concern, David M.
Dunne, was very popular. He made friends and treated
them right and they were staunch and loyal.
</p>

<p>
The Portland Ice Company bought a great deal of oil
from Mr. Dunne, and notwithstanding all kinds of inducements,
no one else could sell oil to the ice company.
</p>

<p>
The foreman of the ice plant swore by the Kelly, Dunne
&amp; Co. product and would treat with much brusquesness
any drummer who had the hardihood to come to him to
dispose of oil. He had full charge of the works and was
held strictly accountable for the welfare of the plant.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Charlie Plummer, who was manager for a competitive
house, had tried in vain to introduce his wares but
the erratic foreman was unswerving in his loyalty to
Dunne.
</p>

<p>
A bright young man, named Tony Neppach, a crack
salesman, was employed by Plummer and it was Tony&rsquo;s
duties to crack all the hard nuts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you to go to the Portland Ice Company and
sell them some oil,&rdquo; said Plummer to Neppach one day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will see that I will do it,&rdquo; responded Tony and
off he put.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come around here with your oil, I don&rsquo;t want it
and I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you on the subject. I am satisfied
and that&rsquo;s all there is to it,&rdquo; vociferously declared the
foreman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but you are talking to an oil man now and my
oil is far superior to the stuff you have been using,&rdquo; replied
the placid Tony.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">56</a></span>
Much talk ensued, Tony protesting that the foreman
could not tell the difference between the oil he was using
and the product he was endeavoring to sell and offered to
set up the cigars for the crowd if he could tell the difference,
but if he failed to tell, then the foreman was to
give him an order for a barrel of oil. It was the noon
hour and some 50 men were witnessing the sale.
</p>

<p>
When the offer was accepted, Tony turned his back to
the foreman and produced a bottle of oil from his coat
pocket, poured a little in each hand which he showed the
foreman, ejaculating, &ldquo;Now, tell me which is your oil
and which is mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The foreman hesitated, looking at one hand and then
the other, finally touching Tony&rsquo;s left hand, triumphantly
remarked, &ldquo;Why, that is my oil.&rdquo; A laugh followed this
from the men who saw how the oil had been manipulated
and Tony told him that he had his oil in both hands.
</p>

<p>
Neppach received an order for a barrel which greatly
pleased his employer.
</p>

<p>
Two weeks passed by and Tony, who had been up the
Valley on a business trip, thought he would drop in at the
Portland Ice Company before reporting to his house.
</p>

<p>
Entering the machine room with a jaunty, nonchalant
air, he began singing in a high pitched voice, &ldquo;How did
you like my oil? How did you like my oil?&rdquo; this to the
tune of &ldquo;Where did you get that hat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The ice plant was in a complete state of chaos, pipes
being torn out and some 25 men were engaged in still
further tearing out the piping. The foreman was up on
a high ladder assisting in the demolishing when he espied
Tony.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There he is, there he is,&rdquo; he yelled and he slid down
the ladder, approaching the drummer with a formidable
looking monkey wrench. His language was strong, full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">57</a></span>
of epithets and he swung the monkey wrench menacingly.
</p>

<p>
Tony picked up a huge rock to defend himself, retreating
backwards to the door, where he beat his way to the
store to ascertain the cause of all this turbulent demonstration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s so, you have been away and did not hear
about it,&rdquo; said the undisturbed Plummer. &ldquo;You see, one
of the boys made a mistake and sent them the wrong oil,
in fact, it was some oil which contained a good deal of
lard oil, and when they turned in the cold water into the
pipes it cooled off the lard and put them out of business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The ice company lost that summer&rsquo;s output and litigation
ensued, which helped to popularize Dave Dunne&rsquo;s
wares and Tony in disgust jumped his job.
</p>

<p>
It was not long after this that Neppach was engaged by
Nicolai Bros. as manager of their planing mill and he was
given full charge of the whole business.
</p>

<p>
Nicolai Bros. owned some land down around Slabtown,
a piece of which they leased to a Swede, who ran a saloon
on the premises.
</p>

<p>
The Swede&rsquo;s lease for three years was about to expire
and as he was doing a good business he became desirous
to lease it for five years longer. When he applied to the
firm, he was referred to Mr. Neppach as the proper person
to negotiate with.
</p>

<p>
Tony saw him coming and determined to have a little
fun.
</p>

<p>
Assuming a very severe air, he asked the Swede whose
beer he sold, the latter explaining that he had made a
reputation with San Francisco beer. &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo;
exclaimed Tony, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t lease from us unless you use
the home product.&rdquo; Some important business at this
juncture engaged Neppach&rsquo;s attention, the Swede departed,
and the incident was temporarily forgotten.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">58</a></span>
A month later, the Swede called to pay his rent and
announced that he was now selling Weinhard&rsquo;s beer and
was ready for the lease.
</p>

<p>
Tony produced a blank form and began filling it out.
He dwelt at length in the preamble over the great superiority
of Weinhard&rsquo;s beer over every known competitor,
and in each sentence would have something to
say about the &ldquo;Celebrated Weinhard&rsquo;s lager beer.&rdquo; He
incorporated in the lease a promise from the Swede that
he never would drink, or allow any of his friends to drink
any beverage, excepting the world famous Weinhard&rsquo;s
beer. Never before or since has there been such an
elaborate lease made up and the funny part is that the
whole matter was a huge joke.
</p>

<p>
A month elapsed and Mr. Weinhard noticed his new
customer. He had been seeking, without avail, the
Swede&rsquo;s patronage, but here he was now, giving good
orders without any solicitation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weinhard determined to ascertain the reason for
this change of heart. The Swede informed him that he
was obliged to patronize him in order to retain his lease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you mind letting me see that lease?&rdquo; queried
Mr. Weinhard.
</p>

<p>
There being no objections the lease was sent to him
for his perusal.
</p>

<p>
No one will ever be able to tell what passed through
the brewer&rsquo;s mind as he read the uncommon document,
but he went to the telephone and called up Nicolai
Brothers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to speak to Mr. Tony Neppach.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said the merry Tony.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is Henry Weinhard and I am putting up a building
on the corner of Fourth and Alder Streets and I want
to tell you that you can have all the mill work there, without
price. Goodbye,&rdquo; and he hung up the phone.
</p>


<p>
Thus did Tony Neppach have his little joke, and his
firm reaped an unlooked for reward for the same.

  <h3><a href="#linkTOC13" title="Link to the table of contents.">A Grapevine Telegraph Line.</a></h3>
  </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">It was</span>
the Fourth of July, 1876, and the City of
St. Louis was celebrating the occasion in the good
old way, which is rapidly becoming merely a matter
of history.
</p>

<p>
The Atlantic &amp; Pacific Telegraph Company had recently
opened an office in the Missouri metropolis, but
the facilities were, indeed, very meagre, consisting of but
one wire to Chicago, which went along the highways and
byways the entire distance. The telegraph company did
a good business, the wire being crowded to its fullest
capacity day and night.
</p>

<p>
The advent of the new telegraph company had brought
into existence a new daily paper, the Morning Chronicle,
which came to fill a long felt want. The Chronicle could
be supplied with press dispatches, a matter of vital moment
in the introduction of a new journal, even in those
days.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the &ldquo;glorious Fourth&rdquo; some
bucolic individual with more enthusiasm than good sense,
shot off several insulators near Alton, breaking the wire,
and as the linemen were off duty celebrating the day the
telegraph company was put out of business pending repairs.
</p>

<p>
The writer was the night operator for this company at
St. Louis at this time, and while regretting the unfortunate
break and loss to the company, it looked like there was
a chance for a holiday.
</p>

<p>
The Chronicle was informed of the situation, and the
telegraph editor, who was also city editor and writer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">60</a></span>
heavy editorials, came to the telegraph office to discuss
some way of obtaining some press dispatches.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to get any dispatches without a wire,
and there is absolutely no use hoping to get one tonight,&rdquo;
was the report made to the editor, who was very much
chagrined. He said he was up against it and he could
not get out a paper unless he had some telegraph news,
and what was he to do? He declined allowing the office
to be closed up till the regular time, hoping against hope
that the wire might come up.
</p>

<p>
It seemed cruel to keep a person from enjoying himself
on the occasion of the nation&rsquo;s Independence day, but
there was nothing to do but to remain on duty. Every
half hour the editor would drop in to ascertain the prospect
and it was really pitiful to observe how disappointed
he was.
</p>

<p>
It grew on till 8 o&rsquo;clock, with no change in the condition
of the wire.
</p>

<p>
Hank Cowan, an interesting character, a fine operator,
but given to drink, stepped into the office to borrow four
bits.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, Hank, I&rsquo;ll make it a dollar if you&rsquo;ll give me a
lift for an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Hank, &ldquo;tell me what to do for I
need a dollar pretty badly tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Connection was made from the manager&rsquo;s private office
to the Chicago table and I began calling St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take that fellow, Hank,&rdquo; was the next order, and
Cowan sat down at the wire.
</p>

<p>
I was doing the manipulating at the key in the manager&rsquo;s
office and said, &ldquo;Here, you are, I&rsquo;ve a bunch of
press reports for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Cowan and I immediately began sending
a lot of fictitious news.
</p>

<p>
The first item was from London and purported to be a
dispatch from Queen Victoria to President Grant, felicitating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">61</a></span>
the United States on its 100th anniversary. This
was followed by one of similar import from the Czar of
Russia and the Emperor of Germany. A graphic description
of the day&rsquo;s doings in New York City was next put
on the 25-foot wire, Hank Cowan copying it in a big
round hand. News from the nation&rsquo;s Capitol came next
making an interesting budget. An imaginary steamboat
explosion on the Mississippi River came next in order
and then a report of a battle in some one of the Central
American States, but as they are fighting down there all
the time, not much chance was taken in making up this
story.
</p>

<p>
A report from Chicago of the day&rsquo;s proceedings followed,
a big fire in the lumber regions of Michigan, and
then the West was supposed to be turned on. Omaha reported
some Indian depredations in the Sioux country,
a big strike in the Comstock mines at Virginia City, loss
of a steamer at sea came from Victoria, B.&nbsp;C., and an account
of one of Denis Kearney&rsquo;s sandlot speeches to his
constituency in San Francisco was given, when the editor
came in.
</p>

<p>
He looked over the &ldquo;news&rdquo; with a gleeful eye and
thanked me again and again and before I could realize
it, walked away with the &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I gasped as I thought what had happened, for it had
been my intention to merely have some fun with Cowan
and make him work for his $1.00. I told Hank that it
was me and not Chicago that had been sending to him
and asked his advice about confessing the situation to
the editor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, let him print it, it&rsquo;s good stuff and no one in St.
Louis will know the difference,&rdquo; was the advice I got
from Cowan and as he was much older and experienced
than me, his advice was accepted.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">62</a></span>
There was no more news sent over the &ldquo;short line&rdquo;
after this and we locked up the office shortly after.
</p>

<p>
I was impatient to get a copy of the St. Louis Chronicle
the next morning, and there were all my dispatches, only
more so, for the intelligent editor had freely padded
them showing that he, too, was quite fertile in his
imagination.
</p>

<p>
Not only were the dispatches printed, but editorial
comment was made on the Queen&rsquo;s alleged telegram to
President Grant, a scathing rebuke was given Denis
Kearney and his followers, attention being particularly
called to the item from San Francisco, in &ldquo;our dispatches.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was a little fidgety for a few days but as time went
by and no mention was made of the hoax, I began to
take more courage and laugh about it.
</p>

<p>
A month later, I resigned to come West and &rsquo;fessed up
to the manager the Fourth of July joke. When the enormity
of the hoax dawned on him, he laughed loud and
hearty, declaring it was the most daring, venturesome
and awful joke he had ever heard. I was freely forgiven
for the part I enacted, but the story was not told to the
paper.
</p>

<p>
This incident occurred many years ago, and in a recent
visit to St. Louis, I looked up this enterprising editor,
who had grown rich in the business.
</p>

<p>
He remembered the Fourth of July, 1876, and all the
circumstances, but when I related the story, he laughed
so heartily that he declared that 10 years had been added
to his life.
</p>

<p>
It would be impossible in this day and generation to
successfully carry out such a joke as is just related, press
dispatches being scrutinized for the &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; with as much
zeal by the diligent telegraph editor as he would a bunch
of dollar bills in quest of counterfeits. And so it happened
again that &ldquo;All is well that ends well.&rdquo;
</p>

  </div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">About</span>
a dozen years ago, B.&nbsp;A. Worthington
was appointed superintendent for the Pacific
Coast division of the Southern Pacific Railroad,
with headquarters at San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
In falling heir to this position, Mr. Worthington also
acquired the private car of his predecessor, which had
been named the &ldquo;Texas.&rdquo; It was agreed, however, that
the name of the car should be changed, as the former
superintendent wanted to give that cognomen to his new
car down South.
</p>

<p>
There was a very wealthy railroad man, in the East,
who used to pay a member of his family $1,000 a year,
in return for which this member would find appropriate
appellations for each new Pullman car turned out at the
shops.
</p>

<p>
Not feeling justified in invoking the aid of such an expensive
person, the new superintendent decided to select a
name, and as the State of California contains many poetical
names to draw from, the time card for the Pacific
division was consulted.
</p>

<p>
Such names as &ldquo;Santa Maria,&rdquo; &ldquo;Santa Margarita,&rdquo; etc.,
were canvassed and rejected, and the little city of &ldquo;Orilla&rdquo;
seemed to proffer its name.
</p>

<p>
By reference to a Spanish dictionary, it was ascertained
that the meaning of the word &ldquo;Orilla&rdquo; was defined,
&ldquo;Along the shore,&rdquo; and as the name was poetical enough
and as his line of railroad ran along the shore of the
Pacific Ocean, he determined to name the car, &ldquo;Orilla.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was a flattering tribute to the town of Orilla, and
on the first appearance of Mr. Worthington&rsquo;s car in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">64</a></span>
little city, the populace showed their appreciation by deluging
the car with flowers.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Orilla&rdquo; had been refitted throughout and was
very beautiful, and all the employes of the road hailed its
coming, for they liked to see it and the popular superintendent,
but there are contrary spirits the whole world
over.
</p>

<p>
One night the superintendent, with his private car, was
coming North, attached to the San Francisco flyer, and
stopped for a few minutes at San Luis Obispo, where
the car inspector came around with his hammer to test the
wheels of each car. Another functionary was also on
duty to take the number or names of each car.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look yere, Chimmie, wot is dis?&rdquo; and he began spelling
out &ldquo;O R I L L A.&rdquo; &ldquo;Begorrah, that&rsquo;s a moighty
funny name.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dat&rsquo;s de old man&rsquo;s private snap&rdquo; (Mr. Worthington
was 35 years old at this time), &ldquo;and he calls it &lsquo;Orilla&rsquo;,&rdquo;
was the other&rsquo;s rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Orilla?&rsquo; &lsquo;Orilla?&rsquo; begorrah and it should have a
&lsquo;G&rsquo; in front of it and I&rsquo;m going to put one there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A can of black paint was produced and quite a decent
looking letter &ldquo;G&rdquo; was prefixed to the car&rsquo;s appellation,
completely changing its euphony.
</p>

<p>
The two worthies laughed at their alleged witticism
and the &ldquo;Gorilla&rdquo; went Northward.
</p>

<p>
From his window in the middle of the car that evening,
Mr. Worthington was a witness of the whole occurrence,
but wisely kept silent. He realized if he made a demonstration,
the employes would have a laugh on him and
jokes travel fast with men employed on a railroad.
</p>

<p>
Arriving in San Francisco, Mr. Worthington had the
car put up immediately in the shops and ordered the name
erased and the less poetic name of &ldquo;Surf&rdquo; substituted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065">65</a></span>
Of course, surf goes along the shore, so virtually the
title was not changed.
</p>

<p>
The jokers at San Luis Obispo had no joke after all,
and probably will never know, unless they read this story,
how it happened that B.&nbsp;A. Worthington so quickly
changed the name of his private car.

<span class="firstWord">Some</span>
six or seven years ago, there lived in Portland,
a rather notorious young chap, named Otto
Prag. He was a messenger boy, private detective,
playwright, actor, candidate for councilman, friend to the
newsboys, etc.
</p>

<p>
About 1907, he went to Spokane, where he pursued his
various callings, adding that of candidate for United
States Senator to the rest of his business qualifications.
He, however, found himself &ldquo;crushed&rdquo; in his vaunting
ambition and he took up the collection of bad debts to
gain a livelihood.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the fact that Arthur Green and Harry
Murphy had immortalized the name of Otto Prag in the
columns of the Oregonian, the young man prevailed upon
the Washington Legislature to allow him to adopt the
name of Arthur Prague, in lieu of his former family
cognomen.
</p>

<p>
Arthur Prague, as he is known now in Spokane became
a benedict some three years ago and is now the proud
father of a very lively boy. This diminutive little chap is
very interesting, and possessing a mercurial nature,
makes the fact patent that he is in existence.
</p>

<p>
The writer was recently in Spokane for a few days,
and ran across the young man of varied occupations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want you to come out to my house and see my baby
and my piano and take dinner with me and my wife,&rdquo; said
the ex-playwright. &ldquo;You will have a nice time and I&rsquo;ll
feed you well, you must come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yielding to these importunities, a day was set and an
automobile took us to the Pragues.
</p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">68</a></span>
Introductions to the family speedily followed, and the
baby, Webster by name, came in for a large share of attention.
He was dandled and tossed in the air till he
fairly shrieked with joy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, let me show you my $550 piano and my $250
phonograph. And here&rsquo;s dinner, too, and I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I have for you to eat today. There is two kinds of
soup, oyster and consomme, then there are three sirloin
steaks, some ham and boulogne sausage, a dozen hard
boiled eggs, tea, coffee and milk, there is three kinds of
pie, mince, lemon and custard, two kinds of cake, some
canned strawberries and peaches, two kinds of cheese,
mashed potatoes, pickles, chow chow, apple sauce and ice
cream and it is all on the table to save time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The table was set for eight persons, but there were only
four of us to partake of this banquet, including the baby.
Every available bit of space on the table was covered and
there was enough edibles in sight to feed 20 hungry
laborers.
</p>

<p>
Arthur sat at the head of the table, his young hopeful
on his right and the writer at the foot, the little wife
flitting around to add a little more to her already elaborate
dinner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Hazel, I want to have our guest hear our $550
piano, please play us some rag time while we eat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was no use protesting and the dutiful spouse sat
down to the piano and began to play, when the telephone
rang and the young papa went out to answer it.
</p>

<p>
Little wee Webster set up a yell, but the mother was so
bent on her rag time piece that she did not notice him.
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily the writer&rsquo;s hands went up into the air,
as if describing the tossing up with which he had been indulging
the child. This was invitation enough for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_069" id="Page_069">69</a></span>
youngster, who started for the other end of the table regardless
of any seeming obstacles in the way. He bounded
out of his high chair, plunking his fat little fists into the
consomme, one foot kicking over the custard pie. Tea,
coffee and milk were brushed ruthlessly aside, the dozen
hard boiled eggs met an ignominious fate on the floor and
the apple sauce and canned berries were tipped over.
Halting for a moment in the middle of the table where he
squatted in the center of three sirloin steaks, he proceeded
to his journey&rsquo;s end, creating havoc and destruction in his
wake. Everything seemed to be a target for the youngsters
efforts, and just as he was about to spring in triumph
into his guest&rsquo;s arms, both parents arrived on the scene
of such wanton destruction. The boy had done a complete
job and the tempting viands of a few moments before
became immediate &ldquo;candidates&rdquo; for the little barrel
furnished by the garbage man.
</p>

<p>
Recriminations between the &ldquo;newly-weds&rdquo; and apologies
for Master Webster&rsquo;s rudeness were in order, but
the occurrence was so humorous that the whilom guest
is still enjoying the memories of the untouched dinner
with the Prague family.

  </div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">In the</span>
earlier days of Oregon the State Fair at
Salem was the great event of the Fall&rsquo;s doings, and
countryman and merchant alike contributed by their
presence to make the fair a success. It was a week when
the old pioneer, who lived in the Grand Ronde Valley
would expect to meet his former neighbor in the East,
who, perchance, located in Yamhill County and, railroads
being scarce, old Bob and Florrie would be hitched to
the prairie schooner that bore them across the plains years
before, to participate in the annual gathering in September
at Salem.
</p>

<p>
More people came from Portland in those days than at
present, notwithstanding the increased population.
</p>

<p>
There were no bridges across the Willamette at Portland,
and ferry boats handled with ease all the travel between
the East and the West Sides.
</p>

<p>
Two brothers were the proprietors of one of these ferry
boats, and the husbands and fathers of the two families
indulgently gave over the proceeds of one day&rsquo;s collection
to their wives and children to spend as they wished
in a day&rsquo;s outing at Salem. Thursday was the day generally
selected and every member of both families excepting
the husbands took the early train for the State Fair.
</p>

<p>
On one of these occasions, along about 1882 or &rsquo;83,
the members of both families were a little slow in getting
started, and Capt. Robinson brought the previous day&rsquo;s
collections, a good sized canvass bag full of silver and
some gold pieces also, to the train, where he handed it
to the mothers for distribution among the flock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How will we proceed to divide the money,&rdquo; was
asked.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">72</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, open up the bag and take out a dollar and I&rsquo;ll
do the same.&rdquo; Which plan was agreed upon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s four bits for you and here&rsquo;s four bits for me.
Now, here&rsquo;s a dollar for you and here&rsquo;s a dollar for me,
and here is two bits for you and here&rsquo;s two bits for me.&rdquo;
Just then one of the youngsters pulled on his mother&rsquo;s
skirts, and down tumbled the coin, necessitating a new
division.
</p>

<p>
The money was put back into the bag and the same
system started over again, only to be found impracticable.
</p>

<p>
Several gold pieces gleamed in the bag, one being a
double &ldquo;sawbuck,&rdquo; as Dixie fantastically described it.
There appeared to be no end to the disputes arising, when
Conductor Stroud was appealed to for some of his wisdom
in aiding a settlement.
</p>

<p>
The conductor had a merry twinkle in his eye when he
suggested that he would be fair to both sides, but they
must agree not to appeal from his method of adjustment,
which was readily consented to.
</p>

<p>
Taking the bag in his hands, Mr. Stroud tied up the
opening, then beginning in the middle he worked one-half
of the coins as nearly as could be guessed to each end
which left a place in the middle of the bag, around which
he securely tied a string, thus making two compartments
in the bag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, we will toss up a copper and see who has first
choice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was harmoniously done and producing a huge
pocket knife, the bag was cut in two at the point where
the string was tied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is what I call &lsquo;Knifin&rsquo; de dough,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed the
jolly conductor.
</p>

<p>
Each one of the bairns was allowed to slip his or her
hand in the bag and take out all it would hold.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">73</a></span>
&ldquo;I wish I had a hand like a ham,&rdquo; cried Gordon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and I picked out the double eagle,&rdquo; triumphantly
exclaimed Miss Dixie, and all were made happy.
</p>

<p>
Semi-annual dividends by our streetcar systems usually
bring gladness to the already bloated stockholder, but they
never can experience the exquisite joy that these two
families had in &ldquo;Knifin&rsquo; de dough&rdquo; on their annual pilgrimage
to the State Fair.

<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
train from the East, bearing a long string of
loaded coaches, had stopped at Wallula for dinner
and amid the din of the sounding gong in the
hand of a burly negro, the passengers alighted to partake
of the Willis&rsquo; bill of fare. This was an important hour
in the day for the little band of Umatilla Indians who
gathered around the station to sell their curios to the
tenderfoot passenger.
</p>

<p>
The captain of these remnants of a once mighty nation
was Hawkeye, a fine specimen of the Indian genus homo.
Hawkeye leaned on the corner of the station dressed in a
becoming Indian garb, looking every inch a warrior.
</p>

<p>
Some of the passengers were walking up and down the
platform, among them being a man from Boston accompanied
by his 19-year-old daughter, who was a most
enthusiastic observer of the country they were passing
through and the people whom they met.
</p>

<p>
Hawkeye soon took her notice, and after scanning him
critically, she cried out, &ldquo;Oh, see, papa, the noble redman
of the woods. How grand he does look! What nobility
is expressed in his countenance and what grandeur there
is in his mein. What a life of adventure has been his
and how, if he could but talk, how he could tell us of the
enemies he slew in battle and how he chased the grizzly
bear to his den and the panther to his lair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Indian was taking in all this flowery oratory, and
expectorating a huge mouthful of tobacco juice, he ejaculated,
&ldquo;Ugh, if white squaw give Hawkeye four bits,
Hawkeye will sing &lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;s Doing It.&rsquo;&rdquo;

  <h3><a href="#linkTOC18" title="Link to the table of contents.">"The Gentleman of Havre."</a></h3>
  </div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
little city of Bodie, California, was known
during its ephemeral existence as being one of
the most lawless and riotous places in the country;
but James J. Hill, erstwhile president of the Great
Northern Railroad is alleged to have declared that the
town of Havre, Montana, on his line of road, was the
toughest, wildest and the least law-abiding place in the
whole country and there was not a person in the town
who was possessed of any higher ambition than to carouse
and indulge in all kinds of forbidden vice.
</p>

<p>
It was to this place that Eddie F. Wach, then 17 years
old, was sent to fill the position of night operator for the
Great Northern road.
</p>

<p>
Eddie had been messenger in the Chicago office and
had readily acquired a practical knowledge of the business
and it was a great day in his existence when he secured
the position as night operator at Havre.
</p>

<p>
The boy&rsquo;s introduction to this delectable office was not
such an one as to enthuse a good young man.
</p>

<p>
Beer bottles, whiskey bottles, cigarette and cigar
butts, stale tobacco smoke and other equally demoralizing
objects met young Wach&rsquo;s attention on his arrival at the
Havre office, and he was besought on all sides to &ldquo;join the
club.&rdquo; The young man&rsquo;s refusal to partake of any of these
alleged &ldquo;refreshments&rdquo; startled all and he became a target
for all the jibes and jeers of the depot habitues and the
rounders about the little city.
</p>

<p>
Young Wach took all this unpleasant demonstration in
a kindly and good humored manner, never saying or doing
anything to antagonize the men around him. He
selected a respectable and quiet boarding place where he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">78</a></span>
would retire when off duty. When pay day arrived he
would figure out his monthly expenses, sending all the
money left over to his parents in Chicago. By his unobtrusive
kindness, and genial disposition, he found favor
in the eyes of the men of whom it had been so frequently
said that there was no good in them.
</p>

<p>
Promotion came to young Wach and a few months
later he was appointed manager of the office. A new
spirit was soon made manifest in the Havre office and all
the evidences of riotousness speedily disappeared and the
room assumed a businesslike air.
</p>

<p>
For more than three years Eddie Wach continued at
this post of duty elevating his fellow men by his example,
never yielding to temptation which at times fairly shrieked
with disappointment in not being able to make him a
convert to the &ldquo;Havre Club&rdquo; principles. Every month the
major part of his salary would be sent to Chicago and
the young man would spend his spare moments in study.
</p>

<p>
A few days before he was to leave Havre, young Wach
received a call from Mr. Broadwater, one of the most
influential citizens of the town and the state. Mr. Broadwater,
although known to Wach in a business way, had
never spoken to him till this day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to tell you,&rdquo; began Mr. Broadwater, &ldquo;that I
have been watching you for the past three years and I
have never seen you do anything unbecoming a gentleman
and I have seen you sorely tried. I don&rsquo;t know of
anyone else like you in our city and I want to tell you that
I consider you the only gentleman in Havre. In leaving
us I want you to bear away with you that distinction together
with our best wishes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that E.&nbsp;F. Wach won the hearts and respect
of the citizens of that little frontier town and now as he
looks back from his present official position in Chicago he
occasionally thinks of the time when he was called &ldquo;The
Gentleman of Havre.&rdquo;

<span class="firstWord">The</span>
late Col. M.&nbsp;D. Crain was a man of decided
personality and made warm and lasting friends.
His practical jokes and queer sayings will be
related as long as there is an old timer alive to tell the
story.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was a stickler for technicalities and was
ready to immolate himself to his own theories.
</p>

<p>
He was in early days manager of the Bloomington,
Ill., office. He was also operator and messenger.
</p>

<p>
Operator Crain would occasionally want to draw some
money and he wanted to do it in the right way. So
Operator Crain would write a note as follows to Manager
Crain:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">M.&nbsp;D. Crain, Manager.</p>

<p>I need $20 very badly today; may I draw the same?</p>

<p class="closing">Signed, M.&nbsp;D. Crain, Operator.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Then Manager Crain would reply:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="greeting">To M.&nbsp;D. Crain, Operator.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Mark, you certainly can draw $20, as you deserve
it.
</p>

<p class="closing">Signed, M.&nbsp;D. Crain, Manager.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
After this formula had been gone through and properly
signed and filed, the Colonel would draw the money,
but not before.

In the 70&rsquo;s there was an operator named Robert C.
Hayes, who worked in Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago and
Omaha. &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; as he was called, was a great operator
and was in demand in emergency cases and it was no
wonder that Charles Selden selected him as one of those
to assist during the national convention held in Cincinnati
in 1876.
</p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">80</a></span>
The convention had been in progress for several days
and everybody was tired and worn out with expectancy.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon Hayes, Tom Dudley and Bob Irwin
were allowed 30 minutes for luncheon. Upon their return,
the doors of the convention hall opened and a mass of
excited men rushed out, yelling, &ldquo;Hayes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hayes!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hayes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Hayes immediately left his comrades
and flew down the street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Tom Dudley after the fleeing
man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, hush! hush!&rdquo; cried back the fleeting Hayes, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you hear my creditors yelling after me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seems the convention had just nominated Rutherford
B. Hayes for the presidency and that alone was the cause
of the tumult.
</p>

<p>
Robt. C. Hayes now holds a prominent position with
the Burlington road in Omaha and his friends still tell

&ldquo;Farmer&rdquo; Lawton has worked in Denver, lo, these
many years. He loves to reminisce and his stories
are good.
</p>

<p>
Back in the 70&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Farmer&rdquo; used to copy press from
&ldquo;Nip&rdquo; Jones, at Cheyenne, for the Denver papers. &ldquo;Nip&rdquo;
was a fast but erratic sender, his speed varying according
to his mood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Farmer&rdquo; Lawton had been &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; a good deal
one night, when Jones petulantly remarked: &ldquo;I say,

The newcomer proved to be very trustworthy, full of
snap, energetic and intelligent.

<p>
Noticing her excellent work and needing still more
help, Mr. Cowan asked the young Jewess if she knew of
any more girls of her race that would like to go to work.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Henrietta, &ldquo;I know many,&rdquo; and in a
few days there was quite a sprinkling of young women of
the Semitic race in the office.
</p>

<p>
Passing into the elevator one day Mr. Cowan overheard

<p>
<span class="firstWord">Some</span>
years ago a fine looking, elderly gentleman
could be seen hob-nobbing with such old timers
on Front Street as Wm. Wadhams, Sylvester Farrell,
Thomas Guinean and others of that generation, and
he was always attentively listened to. There was so much
of benevolence and philanthropy in his countenance that
one involuntarily took a second look at him.
</p>

<p>
His name was Jim Winters, and he lived on a little
farm down the river, where he did a little cultivation of
the soil, but spent much of his time acting as a fire
warden, protecting the forests from careless hunters.
</p>

<p>
One day Winters appeared in Portland and announced
that he was going to quit the country and would make
California his future home, and much regret was expressed
by his friends over his decision.
</p>

<p>
Jim Winters went to California, locating in the Sacramento
Valley, near the little town of Vacaville, where he
bought a small piece of land, and proceeded to put it in
a state of cultivation.
</p>

<p>
Although practically a farmer on a small scale, Jim
Winters went about doing all the good he could, alleviating
suffering and want as much as laid in his power. He
was present at the sick bedside of friend or stranger, and
Chinaman, Japanese or negro were, alike, his brothers,
and would receive his care, if sick or in distress.
</p>

<p>
He did not have much to go on, but what he possessed
was freely given, and Winters made many friends in that
little community.
</p>

<p>
There was a Bible in the Winter&rsquo;s cabin and some curious
friend, in looking it over, discovered that Jim&rsquo;s
birthday was the 10th of September, and it was deemed
that the proper thing to do to celebrate such an event
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">84</a></span>
would be to supply his larder and other wants by donations
from among the friends he had made in the valley.
</p>

<p>
Everybody seemed to have an offering to make and
varied were the presents tendered.
</p>

<p>
There was a smoking jacket from Mrs. Jones whose
husband he had nursed during his last illness without
compensation, there was a pair of slippers from Mrs.
Smith, as a recognition of services rendered her father, a
box of cigars from Wing Fat, a Chinaman to whom Winters
had been kind, tea and coffee from Harra Alodsta,
the young Japanese who had been nursed through the
smallpox, and many others who came with presents until
the little cabin was full to running over.
</p>

<p>
The company gathered to pay their respects, and as
each package was open for inspection, some merriment
was caused by the curious presents which sometimes were
offered. For instance, James Ladd tendered a present
of a Boston bull pup, Mrs. Thompson gave a present of
two small kittens, but it was not till a modest looking
package offered by George Stroud was received that
everybody was agog with expectancy.
</p>

<p>
The package was wrapped up in true express style, indicating
the donor was an adept in the art of proper
wrapping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; was asked on all sides and many conjectures
were made.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looks like a package of music,&rdquo; said one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It might be a new Bible, for it is paper and weighs
heavy,&rdquo; ejaculated another, but all were disappointed.
</p>

<p>
When the package was opened a lot of old papers
tumbled out, in a more or less state of dissolution, some
whole and some quite dilapidated.
</p>

<p>
Everybody laughed, but seemed to regard the joke as a
little untimely.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">85</a></span>
&ldquo;Hold on here, my friends,&rdquo; cried Winters, &ldquo;this is no
joke. I say this is not a joke. Why, my friends, these
here papers are Oregonians, and I have not seen a copy
of the Oregonian for nigh onto 15 years. Yes, my friends,
I appreciate all your presents, but these Oregonians are
more precious than anything else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It therefore was apparent that Jim Winters showed
where his heart was, for &ldquo;Where your treasure is, there
will your heart be also.&rdquo;

<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
Chicago office of the Western Union Telegraph
Company (in 1877) had been noted for
the manliness of its employes, who realized
that they were men and women, and for this reason
entitled to the consideration of the local as well as the
general officials.
</p>

<p>
It became necessary, sometimes, to have this fact impressed
on the minds of those immediately in charge, who
relegated to themselves authority not vested in them.
</p>

<p>
It was considered the wise thing to hire a hall, and
there to meet once a week to discuss the situation, and to
determine upon the most businesslike manner of procedure
to meet the exigencies of any case in hand.
</p>

<p>
Platt&rsquo;s hall, on the south side, was selected for this
purpose, and every Sunday, a meeting was held, to discuss
the complaints and grievances of the employes assembled.
</p>

<p>
Wm. J. Lloyd was the presiding officer on these occasions,
and he was a glorious worker in the cause.
</p>

<p>
Much good resulted from this &ldquo;getting together&rdquo; and it
was found to be a simple matter to adjust the grievances,
once they were uncovered and aired.
</p>

<p>
There was present at one of these meetings, B.&nbsp;E.
Sunny, who was night manager for the Atlantic &amp; Pacific
Telegraph Company. This company never had any trouble
with their employes, and if one were disposed to do half-way
right, he would not be censured or reprimanded by
his superiors, and the office was very pleasant to work in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I notice we have Mr. Sunny, of the A.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;P. with us
today,&rdquo; remarked President Lloyd. &ldquo;We would like to hear
from him, and if he has any grievance against his company,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">88</a></span>
we would like to have him state the nature of it
and we promise to try and adjust the difficulty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sunny protested that he came to attend the meeting
merely as an on-looker, and knew of nothing that he
could enter a complaint against.
</p>

<p>
The president demurred at this statement, saying he
could not conceive of such an earthly paradise as a telegraph
office where all were satisfied and where there were
no grievances.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, come to think of it, there is a grievance we have
that should be remedied,&rdquo; said Sunny. &ldquo;I have spoken to
the manager and superintendent, but with no avail, and
the evil still continues. Our cuspidors in use at our office
are not much larger than a tea cup and wholly inadequate
to take care of the expectorations of a liberal user of the
weed, and I have asked for larger utensils to accommodate
these copious expectorations, but no relief has as yet
come and I think it will require executive action to force
the issue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The matter is referred to the Grievance Committee
with request that it be adjusted at once,&rdquo; said President
Lloyd, and the meeting was adjourned.
</p>

<p>
It is related that more elaborate cuspidors graced the
Atlantic &amp; Pacific operating room a few days later, indicating
the efficacy of determined organization.

  </div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">The</span>
following story has been told and re-told
years ago, in most every large telegraph office
in the country, but has never appeared in print.
The incident is quaint and worthy of a place in the literature
of the telegraph.
</p>

<p>
Jake Tallman was a well known itinerant knight of the
key and in the course of his meanderings found himself
one summer day in the City of New Orleans. Tallman
was a fine operator and a good, companionable fellow,
but, as the boys used to say, it was as hard to enter the
kingdom of heaven as it was to obtain a position in the
New Orleans office. Considerable diplomacy was therefore
necessary to ascertain the entering wedge.
</p>

<p>
There happened to be a vacancy in the office about the
time of Tallman&rsquo;s arrival and his old friend, Dick Babbitt,
determined to assist in placing him.
</p>

<p>
David Flannery was the superintendent and he was a
&ldquo;Fine old Irish gintleman, one of the rare old kind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Babbitt related to his friend that it would be a good
stunt to go to church the following Sunday and take a seat
in Mr. Flannery&rsquo;s pew and by some means attract that
gentleman&rsquo;s attention to his presence. This would serve
to pave the way to an introduction the following day when
he could plead his cause.
</p>

<p>
Acting on the suggestion, Tallman sallied to church a
little ahead of the other worshippers, and asked for, and
was escorted to the Flannery pew.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the superintendent came leisurely
up the aisle and took his seat along side of his expectant
employe.
</p>

<p>
Tallman was not familiar with the order of procedure
in churches, but carefully watching others and following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">90</a></span>
their example he was able to pass off as one of the most
devout. In the course of the services, he handed Mr.
Flannery a book, who glanced at it and put it aside, giving
the irrepressible Jake a stony glare which would seem
to say that the young man did not know his business, and
Tallman felt rebuked but not intimidated.
</p>

<p>
The following morning Tallman called at Mr. Flannery&rsquo;s
office and after the regular morning salutations had
passed between them, he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Flannery, I saw you at church yesterday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you are the young man that sat in my pew and
tried to show me some courtesies,&rdquo; replied the affable
superintendent.
</p>

<p>
Believing that he had created a good impression Tallman
grew bolder, and said that he believed in going to
church on Sunday and related an imaginary conversation
in Omaha several years before. Flannery appeared interested
and finally asked what service he could be to his
visitor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I tell you, Mr. Flannery, I am an operator and
I am looking for a job and I understand you have a job
here at the present time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Flannery placed his spectacles on the end of his
nose and giving the applicant a very severe look, which
was intended as a reprimand, ejaculated in an icy tone:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young man, I want yees to know, that my operators
are all gintlemen. We don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;jobs&rsquo; here, but we
sometimes have vacancies.&rdquo;

</div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">It was</span>
in the Nation&rsquo;s centennial year that the
writer was employed by the Western Union Company,
at St. Louis, and worked, what was called in
those days, the &ldquo;Long Horn&rdquo; wire to Texas.
</p>

<p>
The hours of labor were from 5 P.&nbsp;M. till lines were
cleared up, generally before midnight, and all bent their
best efforts in keeping business moving.
</p>

<p>
An adjournment to Sprague &amp; Butler&rsquo;s rotisserie after
the evening&rsquo;s work was performed, where a substantial
spread was in readiness, was next in order, and here it
was that &ldquo;shop talk&rdquo; was indulged in and a good time was
sure to follow.
</p>

<p>
Fred B. Moxon was the pride of the office. He was
still in his teens, but a master of his chosen profession. He
worked the New Orleans wire, opposite the renowned
Bert Ayres, the finest operator in the world, and the
amount of business handled on that wire was marvelously
great. Ayres and Moxon would get down to their
work as if they had not a second to spare, but the effort
was easy for them and neither suffered from nervous
prostration.
</p>

<p>
One night there happened to be unusually heavy business
on the New Orleans wire, but just at 11:55 P.&nbsp;M.,
Moxon sent his last message, remarking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off now,
good night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a second,&rdquo; said Ayres, &ldquo;our N.&nbsp;Y. wire is
down and we have about 100 messages to go there and
you&rsquo;ll have to relay &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Visions of a deferred lunch and a weary walk to his
room on Targee Street, all alone, flitted across Mox&rsquo;s
mind, but he had lots of friends, who were ready to help
out with their services.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092">92</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a scheme,&rdquo; cried Moxon, and the services of
Sid Fairchild were secured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you cut the N.&nbsp;O. wire in on four different
local setts,&rdquo; which was speedily done.
</p>

<p>
Moxon secured the aid of Charlie Day, Thomas P.
Wheeler and the writer, who took their respective seats
at the quartette table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Bert, tell me just how many you have on hand,&rdquo;
asked the St. Louis man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are precisely 120, and they are all night messages,
all from New Orleans and all are destined for
New York.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, you need not say &lsquo;night message,&rsquo; omit the
place from, date, all punctuations, &lsquo;sig&rsquo; and cut &lsquo;em to the
bone,&rdquo; came from St. Louis, &ldquo;and mind you, hurry up,&rdquo;
taunted Moxon.
</p>

<p>
This was probably the first time in his life that Albert
Ayres was requested to &ldquo;hurry up,&rdquo; he being used to hear
the opposite, &ldquo;to slow up,&rdquo; and his black eyes snapped in
anticipation of the fun he was about to have.
</p>

<p>
His key flew open and a fire of dots and dashes ensued,
which to a layman might sound like shot poured into a
tin horn.
</p>

<p>
The reputation of the whole office seemed to be at
stake, and all gathered around to see, what was rightly
thought would be an unparalleled feat of rapid transmission.
</p>

<p>
Moxon took the first message, Day the second, Wheeler
the third, while the writer handled the fourth, each rotating
in this manner, filling in dates, destinations, etc.,
awaiting his turn to copy the next message.
</p>

<p>
The excitement was intense when it was announced
that 12 messages had been received in five minutes.
</p>

<p>
There were no breaks, or interruptions, and at 12:55
A.&nbsp;M., precisely 55 minutes from the starting time, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">93</a></span>
120 messages were received and were en route to New
York, accomplishing, probably, the most unequalled feat
of fast sending ever attempted.
</p>

<p>
The matter was kept an office secret and Moxon received
much credit. It never leaked out how his tact
secured ready co-operation and enabled him to cope with
a difficult situation.

  <h3><a href="#linkTOC24" title="Link to the table of contents.">His Old Kentucky Home.</a></h3>
</div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">While</span>
traveling recently through the South,
the writer was marooned for several hours
near Horse Cave, in Kentucky. The Cumberland
River was very high, swamping the darkies&rsquo; cabins
en route, compelling the colored people to take refuge on
their roofs, where they waited &ldquo;fo&rsquo; de ribber to go down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The negroes accepted the situation very cheerfully,
many playing their banjoes and singing olden time melodies
and making light of their predicament.
</p>

<p>
Almost involuntarily, I began humming &ldquo;My Old Kentucky
Home&rdquo; and my thoughts were of the &ldquo;yellow fields
o&rsquo; corn,&rdquo; when a voice behind me inquired, &ldquo;Do you like
that song?&rdquo; I assured him that the tune was all right,
but the words were a trifle silly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;the words and
air are both very sweet to me, and if you&rsquo;ll make room for
me, I&rsquo;ll tell you how that song compelled me to make a
trip of 2,000 miles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Space was given him and he began his narrative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was five years ago that I was induced to go west by
the alluring advertisements of the railroad company, who
related how easy it was to speedily get rich in Colorado.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I started with my outfit and a couple of weeks later
located at Cripple Creek, then a prosperous mining camp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, stranger, I didn&rsquo;t like it there in the mountains, I
couldn&rsquo;t get used to the country and the people, and the
climate was so different from &lsquo;Old Kaintuck.&rsquo; Why, it
was just as liable to snow on the 4th of July as it was on
the 1st of January.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was very lonesome for me and I longed to be home
again with my dear old friends, and I determined to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">96</a></span>
at home if I ever got back. You have no idea what
homesickness is until you have had the actual experience.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About 11 o&rsquo;clock one night, I was passing a saloon
near my home when I heard a phonograph playing &lsquo;Kentucky
Home.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I entered the place and asked the bartender to change
a silver dollar into nickels, which he did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I sat down by the phonograph and played that piece
over and over and over again, till my nickels were gone,
then I changed another dollar which went the same way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was, by this time, completely saturated with &lsquo;My Old
Kentucky Home&rsquo; and the longing to return came so
strong that I straightway went to my hotel, packed my
trunk, paid my bill, purchased a ticket for Louisville and
took the 4 A.&nbsp;M. train for Denver, from whence I departed
for home and here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to live and
die, in spite of all inducements to show me some more
favored clime.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I love &lsquo;Kaintuck&rsquo; and I love that old song you
hum,&rdquo; and the stranger was singing his favorite air when
the train pulled into Horse Cave.

  <h3><a href="#linkTOC25" title="Link to the table of contents.">The Office at Spirit Lake.</a></h3>
</div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">Mr. Hugh McPhee</span>,
the superintendent of
the Western Union Telegraph Company at
Los Angeles, Cal., was night operator at Spirit
Lake on the trans-continental line in his early boyhood
days. Every operator that worked for the trans-continental
line knows Spirit Lake because each one of them
served an apprenticeship at that station.
</p>

<p>
The O&rsquo;Shaughnessys kept a boarding house at Spirit
Lake, the only house at this dismal place, but because
young McPhee insisted upon wearing a &ldquo;boiled&rdquo; shirt
and white collar, he found himself debarred from putting
his feet under the O&rsquo;Shaughnessy table. The young man,
however, was full of resources and determined to do his
own cooking and sleep in the office.
</p>

<p>
The first station east of Spirit Lake was then called
Hades and the station west was named Satan. McPhee
would get his milk and eggs from Hades and his staple
groceries and meats from Satan. The names of these
stations have long since been changed to something more
euphonious.
</p>

<p>
The fact that there was an operator in Spirit Lake
office at night induced the belated trainmen to call upon
him repeatedly for orders helping them over the road
and presently McPhee found he was working as much
at night as he was during the day. An appeal to the superintendent
was made and a few days later the train stopped
at Spirit Lake and a tall young man, very dudishly
dressed, stepped into the office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My name is Archibald Merriman and I am to be night
operator at this station,&rdquo; began the young man. &ldquo;Where
can I find a boarding house?&rdquo;
</p>


<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">98</a></span>
Young McPhee told him that he would have to take
&ldquo;pot luck,&rdquo; that there was no hotel or boarding house,
but that he could share his commissary.
</p>

<p>
This did not seem to greatly enthuse Merriman, who
stated that he did not know how to cook or make a bed.
He was from Nova Scotia and he thought that if he could
go back there he would never return.
</p>

<p>
He worked for five nights and one morning he was
missing and nothing was ever heard of him afterwards.
</p>

<p>
An old Indian called &ldquo;Big Thunder,&rdquo; but better known
as &ldquo;Medicine John,&rdquo; was a frequent visitor to this lonely
depot and he suggested that the &ldquo;Evil Spirits&rdquo; in the lake
might have kidnapped the night operator and thrown
him into the lake, and inasmuch as no claim was ever
made for the five days&rsquo; work performed by Merriman,
a matter so very unusual to the telegraph company, one
is lead to believe that the old Indian was correct.
</p>

<p>
Big Thunder had purchased from Merriman a big
brass watch and chain, which he carried on the outside
of his coat. The Indian had also fallen heir to Merriman&rsquo;s
plug hat which is still historical in Spirit Lake.
When Big Thunder was asked the time, he would gravely
open the watch, gaze for a minute at the hands and give
out the information &ldquo;Just half an hour.&rdquo; Were he asked
a hundred times a day, he would never deviate from his
reply, &ldquo;Just half an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Spirit Lake is now a great summer resort. The
O&rsquo;Shaughnessy hovel has made way for a very pretentious
hotel, &ldquo;Big Thunder&rdquo; no longer gives out the
correct time to enquirers and the spirit of progress is
marching on.

  <h3><a href="#linkTOC26" title="Link to the table of contents.">The Indians Were Too Loyal.</a></h3>
</div>

<p>
<span class="firstWord">There</span>
are but few oases in the great Arizona
desert, and that part of our glorious country
offers few allurements to the American youth.
Hence it was a surprise to the friends of young Clarence
Vincent when he took his departure from the fleshpots of
San Francisco to take up his line of march to Maricopa
Wells, where he accepted the position as manager for the
telegraph company at that point.
</p>

<p>
Besides the white inhabitants of Maricopa, which numbered
twelve men and one woman, there were a goodly
number of Indians who, following a migratory inclination,
made the Wells a starting, as well as a finishing
point, in their junketings on box cars and flat cars
throughout the territory of Arizona.
</p>

<p>
These native sons and daughters were ardent admirers
of the telegraph and sometimes of the operator of the
telegraph, and male and female would cluster around the
tiny office, watching young Clarence as he sat at work at
his key.
</p>

<p>
Many of these aboriginies were interesting characters,
and as the weeks glided by, Vincent acquired enough of
the Indian tongue to make himself intelligible to the
pretty maidens of the cactus territory. These shy maidens
were not unlike their white sisters, and a little flattery
was gratifying to their vanity, and when Vincent in his
Indian monosyllabic dialect told Miss Mahala that her
new pink blanket was very becoming, and when he assured
Mahala&rsquo;s cousin, Cahecha, that the blue ribbons in
her hair made her look like a queen, he entirely won their
hearts.
</p>

<p>
During the two years and more that Clarence Vincent
tarried at Maricopa Wells, he made the acquaintance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
pretty nearly the entire Indian tribe in that section and
when he left to accept the managership of the Phoenix
office he was given a genuine Indian farewell.
</p>

<p>
A year or so later Clarence Vincent had become one of
the leading citizens in Arizona&rsquo;s metropolis; he had renounced
the frontier garb worn by the denizens of the
Wells, and donned in its stead a faultless tailor-made suit,
and he was quite a Beau Brummel in Phoenix society,
where he was thought the &ldquo;proper caper&rdquo; by the young
ladies.
</p>

<p>
The Indians of Maricopa Wells still took advantage of
the indulgence of the railroad company and pursued their
migratory practices. One day Clarence Vincent started
for lunch and noticed at a nearby fruit and confectionery
store a crowd of some twenty-five Indians, mostly squaws
with papooses swung over their backs and some young
Indian maidens. He passed them by without giving them
any attention, but not so the Indians; they had recognized
in him the telegraph operator of Maricopa Wells, and
with many guttural &ldquo;Ugh, Ugh, Ugh&rsquo;s&rdquo; they followed
him down the street single file to his favorite restaurant,
where they stood on guard on the outside, varying their
watch by pressing their noses to the window panes in true
Indian style.
</p>

<p>
Young Vincent was greatly chagrined with so much attention
and consideration from his former playmates of
the oasis, but he was reluctant to introduce these simple
children to the select society in which he moved, and he
compromised the matter by buying them one and all, a
box of bon bons at the nearest confectionery store.
</p>

<p>
This incident occurred many years ago, but Mr. Vincent,
now the dignified and courteous manager of the
Western Union Telegraph Company, of Oakland, Cal.,
loves to linger over the memory of the happy days he
spent in Arizona.

  <h3><a href="#linkTOC27" title="Link to the table of contents.">A
  Governor for Fifteen Minutes Took the Bull by the Horns.</a></h3>
</div>


<p>
<span class="firstWord">It was</span>
ten minutes past the midnight hour; the
last train for the night had pulled out, and J. Frank
Howell, the night operator at Tin Cup, Ariz., began
preparations for a little rest.
</p>

<p>
It was in the month of August, and the full harvest
moon beamed down through the clear atmosphere resplendent
and as bright almost as the midday sun. Glancing
out towards the south trail Howell could see a horseman
coming at full speed towards the lonely station. A
few minutes later an active, fine looking man hurried in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a very important telegram to send to the Governor.
I must get an answer in half an hour or an innocent
man perishes. Come, do all you can and as quickly
as you can!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The speaker was Lee Henniger, the sheriff of Dos
Cabezas. He had ridden forty miles since nine o&rsquo;clock
over the sandy desert to Tin Cup hoping to obtain a reprieve
for Bob Beecher, who was under sentence to die
at daybreak for murder.
</p>

<p>
A few hours previous a dying Mexican had confessed
to the murder of which Beecher was to suffer. Frank
Howell spent five minutes in vain to raise &ldquo;Px.&rdquo; He
knew that the night operator there was taking press reports
and could not hear him. Being, however, full of resources
he called up the St. Louis office and sent the following
message: &ldquo;Chief operator, San Francisco: Have
Phoenix answer on local quickly, a man&rsquo;s life is in
jeopardy.&rdquo; Signed, &ldquo;Howell, Tin Cup.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was with great joy that he heard an answering tick,
tick from &ldquo;Px&rdquo; a few minutes later, and the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
telegram was put on the wire: &ldquo;Governor Smithers,
Phoenix: Information just elicited that proves that
Beecher condemned to be executed at daybreak this morning
is innocent. Please wire reprieve, not a minute can be
lost.&rdquo; Signed, &ldquo;Lee Henniger, sheriff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The operator at &ldquo;Px,&rdquo; Paul G. Tompkins, realized the
importance of the message and standing San Francisco off
for a few minutes hastened to deliver the telegram.
</p>

<p>
Arriving at the Governor&rsquo;s house, instead of finding
the mansion dark and everybody asleep he was surprised
to observe a big crowd of ladies and gentlemen seated on
the veranda, while strains of popular music from the ball
room filled the air. Tompkins quickly asked for the Governor
on important business and he noticed that there
seemed to be some hesitancy in sending for him. Presently
a lady, the Governor&rsquo;s wife, came to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your business do in the morning?&rdquo; was asked.
Tompkins replied in the negative and the lady withdrew,
a gentleman appeared to represent her. &ldquo;The Governor
has retired,&rdquo; said this gentleman, &ldquo;and cannot be disturbed
until morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tompkins inquired for the private secretary and also
for the Secretary of the Territory and ascertained that
both these functionaries were out of town.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you possibly awaken the Governor?&rdquo; queried
Tompkins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. To tell you the truth about it, the Governor
unfortunately drank a little too much wine and Warwick
whiskey and he is dead to the world; a gatling gun would
not arouse him, and he is absolutely off the face of the
earth until nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning,&rdquo; was the information
given young Tompkins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then this glorious territory is at present without a
Governor, private secretary, or Secretary of the Territory,&rdquo;
ejaculated Tompkins. As he wended his way back to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
office, he had made up his mind what to do and proceeded
to carry out his determination.
</p>

<p>
He called up Tin Cup and sent the following telegram:
&ldquo;To Lee Henniger, sheriff Dos Cabezas: The reprieve
is granted to Robert Beecher for ten days. Regular papers
go forward in the morning mail.&rdquo; Signed, &ldquo;H.&nbsp;Y.
Smithers, Governor, per Paul G. Tompkins, acting Governor
pro tem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning Paul Tompkins appeared
at the capitol, telegram in hand, which he handed the
Governor, who looked a wee bit groggy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; said the Governor. &ldquo;This telegram
should have been delivered ten hours ago, why was it
not?&rdquo; and the Governor grew very much excited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the reason, Governor, that you were &lsquo;under the
weather&rsquo; and couldn&rsquo;t be wakened, and there was nobody
in the city to attend to your business,&rdquo; replied the placid
Tompkins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then the poor fellow is hanged by this time, and I
am guilty of the execution of an innocent man,&rdquo; and the
Governor broke down completely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would have been true had it not been that I took
the liberty of usurping your place for fifteen minutes,&rdquo;
and Tompkins showed the telegram he sent in reply.
</p>

<p>
Governor Smithers was overjoyed with Tompkins&rsquo; actions
and thanked him again and again, and a few weeks
later he further showed his appreciation by appointing
Paul G. Tompkins to a lucrative position in the Territory.
</p>

<p>
Sheriff Henniger arrived in Dos Cabezas in the nick of
time. The rope was already around Beecher&rsquo;s neck when
one of the deputies who was standing near, spyglass in
hand, recognized his chief coming down the trail swinging
aloft a paper which was proved to be the first and
only official act of Paul G. Tompkins, acting Governor
pro tem.

A party of thirteen left Boston in May, 1888, bound
for the West. It consisted of John B. Lansing, his wife
and her sister, and eight young fellows around town,
well to do and of an adventurous turn of mind, the party
being under the guidance of two middle-aged prospectors.
These two latter personages had come to Boston to organize
this party for the purpose of prospecting and developing
some alleged wonderful gold mines in Southern
Nevada and California.
</p>

<p>
The members of this little party were in high spirits as
they pursued their journey to the far West; the grandeur
of the scenery and the vastness of the country filling all
with awe and admiration.
</p>

<p>
Many stops were made en route on the trip, mostly in
Colorado, Wyoming and Utah. At one of the stations in
Colorado Mr. Lansing and his wife formed the acquaintance
of a telegraph operator. He had passed the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
age, but was hale and hearty. He appeared to be thoroughly
conversant with the country, and as the party
numbered the unlucky thirteen the operator was asked to
join the adventurers, which he did. It is said that his
singing &ldquo;The Old Oaken Bucket,&rdquo; which was rendered in
a most artistic manner, was one of the leading attractions
that enabled the telegraph operator to be offered a place
with the party.
</p>

<p>
It was some time in July, 1888, that a caravan composed
of seven wagons drawn by a dozen horses and a
yoke of oxen made their departure from Reno, Nev.,
bound south. No address was left with any of the merchants
who fitted out the party, and it appeared as if that
were to be a secret. There were two ladies in the party,
properly dressed for the occasion. The ox team was
driven by a man of fifty-five or thereabouts, who seemed
to be the life of the caravan. He was continually cracking
jokes upon his comrades, and just before leaving, he
with three other good voices, sang, &ldquo;The Old Oaken
Bucket,&rdquo; which received a rousing encoure.
</p>

<p>
As the caravan paid cash for everything they obtained,
the episode of their coming and going passed out of the
minds of most everyone excepting the several persons
that helped to outfit the party.
</p>

<p>
The caravan went due south through Carson and Jack&rsquo;s
Valley, where they entered the sterile country once known
on the maps as the &ldquo;Great American Desert.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was in June, 1907, that Eugene Burdick, mining engineer,
civil engineer and prospector, residing in
Tuolumne County, Cal., received a letter from Boston,
which read as follows:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am seeking information regarding a party that left
Boston in May, 1888, bound for Southern Nevada and
California. I am willing to pay $5,000 for authentic information,
which will enable me to establish beyond any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
doubt the fate of these people. There were thirteen persons,
two women and eleven men. The leader of the
party was John B. Lansing, and it is of his fate that I
desire to know, because a large estate is in litigation. The
last heard from Lansing, was from Reno, Nev., in July,
1888.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Burdick was well acquainted with all the country leading
from Reno to the south, and readily accepted the mission.
His visit to Reno elicited the facts related above,
and taking up the clue Burdick began his laborious task
of finding the lost caravan. Carefully he followed them
across mountains and desert, through what looked like
inaccessible canyons, but not one item of intelligence
could he learn of the missing ones.
</p>

<p>
It was on the evening of the seventh day after leaving
Reno that Eugene Burdick stopped for the night at the
wickiup of Shoshone Joe on the border of Death Valley.
This Indian had lived in and around this neighborhood
with his wife Sally for more than twenty-five years, and
was a character well known to emigrants and prospectors.
</p>

<p>
A present of a few trinkets to the Indian made him
quite friendly. Burdick enquired if they had ever seen a
caravan of seven wagons passing that way long ago.
Shoshone Joe with many &ldquo;ughs,&rdquo; &ldquo;ughs,&rdquo; picked up seven
twigs, which he placed in the ground in a straight line a
few inches apart, and then taking a stick with one sweep
knocked them all down, dramatically exclaiming, &ldquo;All
gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Burdick inferred from this that the Indian knew something
which might assist him in finding the lost ones. He
gathered that the Indian had seen the party, and had
furnished them with fresh water prior to their crossing
the valley. A blinding sand-storm occurred a few hours
later, and the caravan lost its way, going south of the
regular trail. Shoshone Joe said, that once when he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
down the valley he could see seven little hills at a distance
of ten miles, but Indian-like, he was afraid of the
&ldquo;Debbil,&rdquo; and he had never investigated.
</p>

<p>
This information interested Burdick very much, and by
making a few more presents he induced the Indian next
morning to come with him and locate the seven hills he
had told about.
</p>

<p>
Taking a two days&rsquo; supply of water and a pick and
shovel, Burdick with his companion started across the
valley in the direction indicated by Shoshone Joe. The
route was arduous, the sand being so deep and fine not
more than a mile and a half an hour could be traveled.
</p>

<p>
Five miles of this wearisome journey had been traversed
when Burdick located, by means of his spyglass,
the seven mounds described by the Indian, at a distance
of probably ten miles away to the south, and this added
fresh impetus to his efforts.
</p>

<p>
Six hours later the twain arrived at the seven mounds.
A vigorous blow with the pick axe felled a mound to the
earth, and two skeletons fell out into the deep sand. The
relics were those of a wagon which was ready to crumble
to pieces, the tires on the wheels being worn as fine as
ribbons. This wagon had been drawn by an ox team, the
horns and bones of which were half covered with the
desert sand.
</p>

<p>
Twenty feet further along was another similar mound.
It took but a little shake to bring the second wagon to the
ground, and two more skeletons were exposed to view.
An object that proved to be a gold watch and chain fell
out into the sand, but was speedily found by the watchful
Burdick. He pried open the case of the watch, and on
the inside read the following inscription: &ldquo;To John B.
Lansing from his wife, Dec. 25, 1886.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&rdquo;This is all the proof that I want,&rdquo; said Burdick, and
bidding goodbye to the gruesome spectacle he beat a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
hasty retreat. The Boston people were satisfied with
Burdick&rsquo;s story, and the evidence that he produced, and
he received the reward.
</p>

<p>
The shifting, treacherous sands now completely cover
the seven little mounds, and all that is mortal of Aaron
Burr Hilliker, telegraph operator, philosopher, bohemian,
gentleman.

<p>
<span class="firstWord">He is</span>
a great banker and broker now, and directs
the finances of a little world of his own, but as
he looks out from his luxurious office on Broadway
on the ever-busy throng on the streets, he grows
reminiscent, and, suddenly scratching his nose, breaks out
into a great laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You noticed me just now scratching my nose, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he said, and he laughed again, &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t see
anything to laugh about, but I remember the time when
it would have cost me my life if I had attempted to do so.
It is a strange story and well worth relating.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The speaker was J. Frank Howell, the noted Broadway
financier and his companion a member of the House of
Morgan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It occurred in 1881, when I was out in Nevada, and
working as a telegraph operator at Beowawa, a little station
on the Central Pacific Railroad. I had acquired a
complete knowledge of the Chinook language, had
become a fair student of Indian poker, could eat jack
rabbits like an Ogallala and considered myself quite a
sport among the children of the sage brush state.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A few weeks of this kind of existence fitted me for
great and more promising fields of usefulness, and when
the gold excitement broke out at Yankee Blade, 125 miles
down the line, I bade goodbye to Johnson Sides, Nastyshack
Jim and other of my playmates, and started on the
stage for Yankee Blade in company with three other adventurous
spirits.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will never be able to explain how it happened, but it
must have been that the outlaw, Jim Slack, knew that I
had drawn my month&rsquo;s salary and that I was aboard the
stage coach, for just as we were leaving Dogtown, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
were halted by a lone highwayman, who lost no time in
ordering us to throw up our hands, forming us into a line
in the rear of the stage. There we were, the four passengers
and &lsquo;Stub,&rsquo; the driver, all with arms pointed
skyward, while the merry Jim Slack rifled our pockets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The bandit cracked jokes with us, saying he was sorry
he had to do it, but he needed the &lsquo;mon,&rsquo; and he hoped
that he wouldn&rsquo;t overlook any small change we might
still have left in our jeans.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At this moment my nose began to itch, but I knew it
was sure death to lower my hand to scratch it, and what
was I to do, for I could hardly stand it? I addressed the
robber: &lsquo;I say, Mr. Highwayman, my nose itches me
pretty badly, won&rsquo;t you please allow me to lower my arm
to scratch it?&rsquo;&rdquo; I asked in a most plaintive manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind, I will do that little job for you myself,&rsquo;
was his reply, and taking the point of his Colt&rsquo;s revolver
he rubbed my nose very briskly till I told him I had
enough, and thanked him for his courtesy, and the passengers
and &lsquo;Stub,&rsquo; the driver, laughed merrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never knew, till I had it done with the business end
of a revolver in the hands of a stage robber, the exquisite
delight of the privilege of scratching one&rsquo;s own
nose.&rdquo;

<h3>Introduction.</h3>
<p>
Welcome to Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s edition of <cite>Portland,
Oregon, A.&nbsp;D. 1999 and other sketches</cite>, a novel by
Jeff W. Hayes.  Hayes also released this book under the title
of <cite>Paradise on Earth</cite>. Aside from the title, the
cover and contents of both books are the same.
</p>

<h4>This Project Gutenberg version.</h4>
<p>
We based our production of <cite>Portland,
Oregon, A.&nbsp;D. 1999 and other sketches</cite>
on the edition of the novel with that title,
published in 1913, by F.&nbsp;W. Baltes and
Company.  We used the scanned copy from the
Bancroft Library of the University of California
available at the Internet Archives as our source.
</p>

<h3>Detailed Notes.</h3>
<p>Instead of correcting (and changing) a lot of
the narrative, we tried to preserve as much of it as
possible. The spelling of words such as encoure, mein,
employe, brusquesness, pleasureable, inadvertantly,
and aboriginies were retained.</p>
<p>We did change familiar or occurrence because these
words were used other times in this book and spelled
correctly those other times. All changes are listed in
the <i>Emendations and Issues</i> section of these notes.</p>
<p>For the few words hyphenated and split between two
lines for spacing in this book, we silently rejoin words
based on other uses of the word in this novel.  When this
book had no template, outside sources were used.  The
author&rsquo;s other books on the Internet Archive provided
some assistance.  Google&rsquo;s
Ngram viewer
identified the most-common spelling of the word for the era.
Some of the harder decisions are listed in the Hyphenated
Words section.
</p>
<p>
Other issues that have come up in transcribing
the book are listed in the Emendations and
Issues section of these Detailed Notes.
